# ENLIGHTEN.MINT.CAFE — Product Requirements Document

## Canonical Category
**Lifestyle · Entertainment · Education · Gamification · Spiritual Instrument.**
A **multi-denominational spiritual exploration and personal sovereignty instrument** — never wellness, medical, diagnostic, or health. The in-app TermsGate, Hub Cross-Tradition mark, manifest description, and Landing disclaimers are the source of truth: *"For Information & Entertainment Purposes Only — spiritual study, not medical advice."* Every module (Breathwork, Herbology, Oracle, Bible, RPG, etc.) is a **byproduct** of the spiritual-study + entertainment-learning experience. Any future agent reading this: do not re-categorize. Do not strip the multi-denominational framing.

## Original Problem Statement
Finalize the "Sovereign Unified Engine" (PWA) for Google Play Store submission under the **Entertainment / Education / Lifestyle / Games** categories. Strict adherence to "Sovereign Math", "Flatland Rules" (no overlays/modals), and a closed-loop economy. Features include: 3D R3F spatial lattice, Single-Plane-Pull state substitution, Cybernetic Loop (Generators → ContextBus → Lattice), Entity Graph knowledge unification, Discovery Economy.

## Architecture Pillars
- **State-Driven Processor** — `ProcessorState.js` swaps `MatrixRenderSlot`, no react-router for tools
- **Entity Graph** — `routes/entity_graph.py` unifies 70+ canonical nodes across 4 silos
- **Cybernetic Loop** — Generators → `ContextBus` → `ResonanceAnalyzer` → `CrystallineLattice3D` + `SageEngineGauge`
- **Closed-loop Economy** — Credits (server-issued) → Dust/Gems/Components via AI Merchant; Stripe is the only real-money gateway

### V1.1.11 — Evolution Lab Refraction Engine + Quiet Rift (2026-02-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Evolution Lab must render 3D, not a 2D spreadsheet. Hide the yellow Check-Engine sticker on the speedometer."
- **EvolutionGemStage3D** wired into `/app/frontend/src/pages/EvolutionLab.js` — one R3F `<Canvas>` mounted above the season banner, fed by the currently-selected specimen. Procedural platonic solids (icosahedron / octahedron / dodecahedron) selected from `crystal_system`; PHI-weighted idle bob + spin from `SovereignMath` (`PHI`, `PHI_INV`); stage rank drives emissive intensity, scale, spin rate.
- **Tap-to-select** specimen cards swap the gem in the 3D stage (no overlay, inline). Active card gets a colored ring + glow.
- **Stage-aware action button** — raw → Polish, refined → Refine, transcendental → Awaken (all three call `/api/evolution/interact` and bump a shared `pulseKey` so the gem visibly pulses scale + emissive on every interaction).
- **Toast spam removed** for evolve interactions. Replaced by an inline `data-testid='evo-reaction-line'` text strip beneath the 3D stage (Flatland-clean).
- **CosmicErrorBoundary** stripped of yellow chrome — no more "Show details / Try Again / Return Home" cluster. Now a single animated glyph line `· a rift in the lattice ·` + `tap to refold` hint. Errors still log to console for debug.
- **Confirmed already-present** (not new): `BlackHillsBathymetry.js` USGS topographic component is wired in `App.js` + `DemoReel.js`; `geospatial_nexus.py` + `refraction_engine.py` exist on the backend.
- Frontend testing agent: 10/10 PASS (canvas mount, WebGL context, auto-select, card swap, pulse-on-interact, no-toast, reaction line, no error-boundary-details-toggle, /forgotten-languages smoke).


## ✅ Completed (Chronological)

### V1.0.14 — Play Store Gold Master Compliance + True 3D Geology (2026-02-04 → 2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "The UI is clean—no constant toolbar. No refunds, No volunteer mode, Transparency Graph only at checkout."
- **Sovereign Founder $1,777 / 24mo / 60% off** — added to `backend/routes/economy.py::SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` with `is_founder=true`, `price_play_store=$2,310.10` (30% gross-up), `price_monthly_equivalent=$74.04`.
- **Sovereign Monthly $89/mo / 30% off** — renamed from legacy "Sovereign" to "Sovereign Monthly", added `price_web=$89` / `price_play_store=$115.70`.
- **Architect → "The Builder"** (15% off) · **Resonance → "Artisan"** (5% off) · **Discovery → "Seeker"** (0%).
- **Backend endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/economy/tiers` — canonical single source, returns `tier_order`, `credit_packs`, `ai_costs`, `platform_fees` (google_play_pct=30).
  - `GET /api/economy/my-plan` — NEW, returns user's active tier + is_founder + term_months.
  - `POST /api/economy/subscribe` — accepts `platform: 'web'|'play_store'`, applies +30% gross-up on Play Store, records term_months + is_founder in transaction.
- **`Pricing.js` rewired** end-to-end to `/api/economy/*` (away from legacy `/api/subscriptions/tiers`). Founder hero, 4-tier grid, policy block. `subscriptions.py` UNTOUCHED.
- **Clean Sanctuary:** persistent platform-indicator banner REMOVED. TransparencyGraph component preserved but dormant — ready to drop into checkout flow only. No persistent upgrade toolbar.
- **Policy block:** "No Refunds · Dust = Hard Currency · Sparks = XP (not currency)" inline on `/pricing`.
- **VOLUNTEER MODE DEACTIVATED:**
  - `POST /api/sovereign/economy/volunteer/check` → **HTTP 410 Gone**
  - `POST /api/sovereign/economy/volunteer/record` → **HTTP 410 Gone**
  - `GET /api/sovereign/economy/volunteer/balance` → read-only (legacy audit trail preserved, no new accrual).
  - `VOLUNTEER_MODE_ACTIVE = False` feature flag. Code preserved for future re-enable.
- **Flatland fix — CosmicCanvas:** `position: fixed inset-0` → `position: absolute inset-0` in `components/starseed/CosmicCanvas.js`. Canvas now contained to parent, not viewport. Resize handler switched to `parent.clientWidth/Height`.
- **Verified live:** curl returns 410 for volunteer endpoints; `/api/economy/tiers` returns all 5 tiers with correct prices; `/pricing` clean (no overlays); `/starseed-adventure` canvas `computed.position === 'absolute'`; mixer whitelist holds (/pricing=hidden, /starseed-adventure=HUD visible).
- **Testing agent:** 16/16 backend tests pass, 100% frontend pass on Pricing + Flatland compliance routes.

### V1.0.14a — True 3D Geology Workshop (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "I'm not waiting another month for a 3D rebuild. Show me a `<Canvas>` and a 3D rock mesh, not 2D bubbles."
- **NEW:** `frontend/src/components/games/Chamber3DGame.js` (~340 lines) — real R3F implementation:
  - `<Canvas>` root with `dpr=[1,2]`, `camera fov=45`, soft shadows
  - Procedurally distorted `IcosahedronGeometry` rock mesh (24 vertices, vertex-displacement noise)
  - Each strike re-displaces vertices → visible cracking/fracturing as damage accumulates
  - `<PresentationControls>` + `<OrbitControls>` for true spatial interaction (drag to orbit, pinch/wheel to zoom, polar/azimuth limits)
  - Shard particle system: 6-10 `<tetrahedronGeometry>` fragments per strike with gravity-decayed trajectories + opacity fade
  - `<Float>` + ambient + directional + colored point light + drei `<Environment preset="night">`
  - Mesh shake on strike, emissive glow flash, haptic vibration via `navigator.vibrate(15)`
  - Same `/api/sparks/immersion` XP backend as 2D version → no economy regression
- **Wiring:** `UniversalWorkshop.js` swaps `ChamberMiniGame` → `Chamber3DGame` only when `moduleId === 'geology' && theme.mode === 'break'`. Other 6 modules (Culinary/Carpentry/Herbology/Academy/Aromatherapy/Physics) untouched.
- **Flatland:** No `position:fixed`, no floating X close. Inline document flow with sequential "FOLD UP" pill at the bottom. Inline header (title + sparks + verb counter) flows above canvas, completion banner unfolds below.
- **Verified live:** `<canvas>` mounted with `[data-testid="chamber-3d-canvas-geology_break"]`. Faceted 3D rock crystal renders correctly on `/workshop/geology` after tool selection.

### V1.0.15 — Sovereign Engine Wiring (math → mesh) (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "Wire the logic to the light. The math you've spent 63 days protecting must move the mesh."
- **Bulk 3D conversion:** Flipped UniversalWorkshop gate from `geology+break` to all `['break','rhythm','collect']` modes. Verified 5/5 modules render R3F: Geology, Electrical, Herbalism, Carpentry, Bible.
- **3 mesh types in `Chamber3DGame.js`** (one file, mode-driven mesh factory):
  - `break` → fracturing IcosahedronGeometry (rock/wood/dough/stone)
  - `rhythm` → pulsing TorusKnotGeometry (current/heartbeat/wind/flow)
  - `collect` → 3x3 OctahedronGeometry field positioned via `toroidalDisplacement` (helix sub-grid for verses/herbs/seedlings/fossils)
- **Wired existing math (no new files):**
  - `lib/SacredGeometry.goldenSpiralPoints` → shard ejection vectors (math-driven, not random)
  - `lib/SacredGeometry.toroidalDisplacement` → 3x3 collect-grid positioning (helix sub-region)
  - `lib/SacredGeometry.GRID_SIZE/TOTAL_NODES` → 9x9 / 81-node constants imported
  - `utils/SovereignMath.PHI` → wave breath frequency
  - `utils/SovereignMath.PHI_SQ` (≈2.618) → squared XP multiplier on Sovereign/Founder completions
  - `engines/LoxIgnitionPulse.getLoxIgnitionPulse()` → shard count modulation per LOX intensity
- **Sage Voice → Mesh reaction (`useSageReaction` hook):** Listens to existing window event bus (`sage:narrate`, `SOVEREIGN_XR_START`, `resonance-change`) — no new Provider added. When fired, all 3 mesh types receive a 700ms emissive pulse spike. Hooks into project's existing `window.dispatchEvent` pattern (already used in 8+ utility files).
- **Tier-gated fidelity (`useTierFidelity` hook):** Reads `zen_tier`/`zen_user_tier` localStorage. Founder/Sovereign/Architect → polyDetail=3, dpr=2, night HDRI Environment, 10-14 shards/strike. Discovery/Seeker → polyDetail=2, dpr=1.25, no HDRI, 6-10 shards.
- **Hollow Earth shell:** `<sphereGeometry args={[14,32,32]}/>` with `THREE.BackSide` + emissive color background. User is INSIDE the chamber, not outside. Opacity tier-gated (4% Discovery, 10% Sovereign).
- **Flatland:** All meshes inline. No `position:fixed`. Sequential FOLD UP pill at bottom.
- **Lint clean. Verified live across 5 routes.**

### V1.0.16 — FFT + Centrifugal + φ² Badge (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate (4 of 10-step protocol):** "FFT Voice-Vertex link, Centrifugal Hollow-Earth gravity, Squared Multiplier Verification, Translator Flatland sync."
- **Step 1 — Real FFT vertex displacement (not emissive flash):**
  - `SageVoiceController.js` exposes `getSageAnalyser()` + `getSageAudioContext()`. Audio element gets `crossOrigin='anonymous'` + a `MediaElementSource → AnalyserNode (fftSize=256)` chain wired just-in-time inside the user-gesture-bound `speak()` call (avoids autoplay policy errors).
  - `useSageFFT()` hook in `Chamber3DGame.js` reads `getByteFrequencyData()` per frame and aggregates into low/mid/high bands.
  - Inside `RockMesh.useFrame`, when total band energy > 0.02, vertices are re-displaced per-axis: low→x oscillation, mid→y, high→z. Real audio-driven deformation. Stops when Sage is silent.
- **Step 3 — Centrifugal Hollow-Earth gravity:**
  - `applyCentrifugal(position, dt, shellR=14)` accelerates particles OUTWARD radially toward the inverted BackSide shell, not down toward a floor.
  - `Shard` particle now uses position+velocity Euler integration plus centrifugal acceleration. Replaces previous `0.5 * 9.8 * t²` floor-gravity model.
- **Step 6 — Visible φ² · 2.618× badge:**
  - Sovereign/Founder completion banner shows inline `data-testid="phi-squared-badge"` chip displaying `φ² · 2.618×`. Reflects the actual `PHI_SQ` multiplier already applied to spark accrual.
- **Step 8 — Translator Flatland sync:** confirmed already live since V1.0.13 (LanguageBar dropdown is inline, no `position:absolute` overlay).
- **Lint clean. Zero console errors on live preview.**

### V1.0.17 — HelixNav3D + Forge3D Gear Train (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "Step 2 + Step 4. Now."
- **Step 2 — `<HelixNav3D>` 9×9 spatial nav** (`/helix-nav`, `/helix`):
  - 81 octahedron nodes positioned via `lib/SacredGeometry.goldenSpiralPoints(81)`
  - 20 modules currently mapped (Geology/Carpentry/Masonry/Culinary/Electrical/Plumbing/Herbology/Aromatherapy/Bible/Academy/Meteorology/Ecology/Paleontology/Nursing/Eldercare/Childcare/Forge/Pricing/Sovereign Hub/Starseed); 61 reserved slots for future expansion
  - `<HelixCurve>` Catmull-Rom curve threaded through all 81 nodes (spline visualization)
  - `<FollowCamera>` lerps to active node on tap (vector-shift feel) before `navigate()` fires (600ms delay)
  - Hover → `<Html>` label tooltip; active route auto-highlights via `useLocation`
  - Accessible 2D fallback list rendered below the canvas (SEO + non-WebGL users)
  - `<Float>` + `Environment preset="night"` + dual point lights (purple + gold)
  - Routes: `/helix-nav` and `/helix`
- **Step 4 — `<Forge3D>` live gear-ratio mesh** (`/forge`):
  - 3 extruded gear meshes: 18T → 12T → 36T
  - Driver ω₁ = 1.5 rad/s constant
  - ω₂ and ω₃ computed via `calculateMechanicalAdvantage('wheel_axle', {wheel_radius, axle_radius})` from `engines/MechanicalSovereignty.js` — math output literally drives mesh rotation in `useFrame`
  - Direction alternates per gear (meshing physics)
  - Live RPM HUD: ω₁/ω₂/ω₃ converted via `60/(2π)·|ω|` displayed as overlay
  - MA + resonance status (PHI_OPTIMAL/SQRT2_EFFICIENT/STANDARD) shown below canvas
  - Routes: `/forge`
- **Test IDs:** `helix-nav-3d`, `helix-nav-canvas`, `helix-nav-page`, `helix-link-*`, `forge-3d`, `forge-3d-canvas`, `forge-3d-rpm-hud`, `forge-3d-fold`
- **Verified live:** both canvases render, no console errors, lint clean.

### V1.0.18 — LOX Particle Solver + Pactola Bathymetry + Flatland Strict (2026-05-06) ✅
- **Step 5 — LOX Particle Field** (`/forge`):
  - `<LoxParticleField>` mounted in Forge3D Canvas. 240-particle `<instancedMesh>` (one draw call).
  - Each particle has position, velocity, life, size. Spawn rate + base velocity scale with `getLoxIgnitionPulse().pressure` and `currentMode`.
  - Mode multiplier: CRUISE=1.0, BOOST=1.6, HYPER=2.4, MAXIMUM=3.5
  - Vapor expands as it ages, drifts upward (buoyancy), recycles via cursor pointer.
  - Inline LOX mode pills (CRUISE/BOOST/HYPER/MAXIMUM) call `lox.currentMode = m` and recompute pressure (φ-stabilized base × mode multiplier).
- **Step 7 — Pactola Bathymetry** (`/pactola`, `/black-hills`):
  - `<BlackHillsBathymetry>` renders procedural 96×96 vertex heightmap modeled on Pactola's actual geometry: Rapid Creek W→E channel, squared-falloff littoral zone, deepest point near dam (150ft).
  - Constants from public USGS / SD GFP data (lat/lon, surface acres, dam date 1956, shoreline 14mi).
  - Water surface plane + red emissive "DEEPEST · 150ft" marker at dam end + gray concrete dam mesh.
  - Data structure swap-ready for real USGS 3DEP DEM tiles when fetched.
- **V1.0.18.1 — Flatland strict purge:**
  - Stripped ALL `position:absolute` from DOM layer of all 5 R3F components (Forge3D, HelixNav3D, Chamber3DGame, BlackHillsBathymetry, TesseractVault).
  - "DRAG TO ORBIT" hints, RPM HUD, helix header, mixer hints now all flow as **inline sequential rows** above/below the canvas.
  - Verified: `grep "position.*absolute"` returns ZERO matches across all 5 components.
- **Lint clean across all 5 R3F components.**

### V1.0.19 — Tesseract Relic Vault (2026-05-06) ✅
- **Step 9 — `<TesseractVault>`** (`/vault`, `/tesseract`):
  - 4D hypercube wireframe: outer cube + inner cube (rotates on PHI-derived axis) + 8 connecting struts. Real tesseract math.
  - 8 Hawaiian relic catalogue (Lilikoi Fudge, Lychee, Macadamia, Koa Wood, Kona Coffee, Black Hawaiian Salt, Taro, Spam Musubi)
  - Relics distributed via golden-angle spiral on a sphere (`Math.PI * (3 - sqrt(5))`)
  - Each relic = clickable icosahedron mesh with color, origin, tier-gating tag (sovereign/architect/all)
  - Tap relic → unfolds inline detail panel below canvas (Flatland: sequential, NO modal overlay)
  - Camera auto-rotates when no relic selected; stops on selection
- **Routes:** `/vault`, `/tesseract`
- **Verified live:** `[data-testid="tesseract-canvas"]` mounts, all 8 relics render and respond to clicks.

### V1.1.10 — Universal Ripple Coverage: EvolutionLab + Glyph Decode (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Every click in the Lab and Languages must cause a physical reaction in the 81-node lattice."

**Two surgical wires, both using the V1.1.6 UnlockBus plumbing:**
1. **EvolutionLab::handleInteract** — every successful Polish / Refine / Awaken action now calls `dispatchUnlock({kind:'evolution', id:assetId+type, color:stageColor})`. Stage color drives the ripple wave color so visual reads connected to the action.
2. **ForgottenLanguages::handleDecode** — every successful glyph decode calls `dispatchUnlock({kind:'glyph', id:glyphId, color:scriptColor})`. Color sourced from the daily script_color or per-glyph color.
3. **ForgottenLanguages::GlyphCard** — V1.1.9 "HEAR IT" pill next to phonetic. Sage speaks `"${name}, pronounced ${phonetic}, meaning ${meaning}"` via cached ElevenLabs (V1.1.6 sage_audio_cache).

**Net effect:** anywhere a HelixNav3D is mounted (Sovereign Hub), the lattice ripples in real-time when the user takes ANY meaningful action elsewhere in the OS — relic claim, glyph decode, gem polish, tier upgrade, refuel. The OS feels sentient.

**Honest scope notes:**
- No "RefractionEngine" exists in `/engines/` — the string appears in 5 comment references only. EvolutionLab has zero R3F imports today; it's a DOM list view. Adding 3D models / carousel is *new work*, not "wiring existing code."
- 123 engine files exist (full audit). Many are domain logic (CrystalsEngine, BibleEngine, etc.) but none renders 3D gems for the EvolutionLab. Procedural icosahedrons exist in `/components/games/Chamber3DGame.js` and `/components/TesseractVault.js` but those aren't lab assets.
- Black Hills USGS DEM pipeline = real half-day work + S3/CDN storage (USGS auth + tile download + decimate + GLB convert + R3F loader). Deferred until stronger telemetry justifies it.

### V1.1.9 — Glyph Audio (Hear It) (2026-05-07) ✅
**User instruction:** "Wire the Audio (B) immediately. A language module without sound is a dead asset."

**Single change — `pages/ForgottenLanguages.js`:**
- Added `SageVoice` import + `handleSpeak` callback in `GlyphCard`
- Decoded glyphs now show inline **HEAR IT** pill next to the phonetic
- One tap → Sage speaks `"${name}, pronounced ${phonetic}, meaning ${meaning}"`
- Uses already-shipped V1.1.6 `sage_audio_cache` so common glyphs cache after first listen
- `SPEAKING` loading state prevents double-tap, error toast on failure

**Verified:** ElevenLabs round-trip 678ms first-time, ~150ms cached. /forgotten-languages serves HTTP 200.


**Mandate:** "Voice button doesn't actually do anything. Translator slow + only does half the info."

**Three concrete bugs fixed:**

1. **Voice translator silently echoed English instead of speaking translation** (`LanguageBar.jsx::useEffect[voice.lastCommand]`):
   - Backend returns `{translation: "..."}` but frontend was reading `data?.translated || data?.text` — both wrong keys → fell through to `transcript` (the English original) → Sage spoke back the English the user just said.
   - **Symptom:** "voice button doesn't do anything" — because nothing perceptibly changed.
   - **Fix:** read `data?.translation` first.

2. **Voice translate path missing auth headers** (same useEffect):
   - Some endpoints / installs require auth on `/translator/translate`. Voice path was sending no Authorization header at all → silent 401 → caught error → empty UI state.
   - **Fix:** read `zen_token` from localStorage and send Bearer header (matches the page-walker's `translateOne` pattern).

3. **Page-walker only did half the page** (`MAX_NODES = 80`, `CONCURRENCY = 3`):
   - Forgotten Languages and SacredTexts pages have well over 80 paragraphs. The hard cap silently dropped the rest.
   - **Symptom:** "only does half the information it used to do."
   - **Fix:** `MAX_NODES = 200`, `CONCURRENCY = 6`. Halves wall-clock time without exceeding per-call 18s timeout.

**Verified end-to-end via curl:**
- `POST /translator/translate {target_lang:'zh'}` → `{translation: "欢迎来到主权样本", target_lang, sacred_mode, sacred_note, tier}` ✓
- Confirmed `translated` and `text` keys do NOT exist in response (which is why the old code silently failed)
- Frontend lint clean, /forgotten-languages serves HTTP 200

**About the production "Dimensional Rift" / token error:**
- The CosmicErrorBoundary already exists and **already has a "Show details" button** that surfaces the actual error message + stack + component-stack to copy-paste.
- All `${token}` references in source were verified to be properly destructured from `useAuth()` or scoped via `localStorage.getItem('zen_token')` in callbacks. The "ReferenceError" on production must come from a code path triggered by user interaction; without prod source-maps or a stack trace from the user clicking "Show details" we can only guess at the file.
- **Action on user:** next time the rift appears in prod, tap the yellow "Show details" pill and screenshot the technical stack. That gives us the exact file + line.
- **No code changed for this** — already-shipped boundary handles it gracefully; reflexively patching scope-leak phantoms without evidence would just add cruft.

### V1.1.7 — Universal Ripple + Sovereign Sample Refuel + LanguageBar truth (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Universal Ripple. $7 Refuel. Finish LanguageBar. Sentient expansion."

**1. Universal Ripple (3 lines, exactly as predicted):**
- `Pricing.js::pollStatus` now calls `dispatchUnlock({kind:'tier', id, color})` on every successful Stripe payment. Tier-color map drives wave color so visual reads connected to the upgrade.
- HelixNav3D mounted anywhere in the OS picks it up and ripples its 81-node lattice — tier upgrade, refuel, founder lock-in all trigger the same lattice-wide acknowledgment.
- Refuel uses `kind:'refuel'` + pink color (`#F472B6`) so it reads visually distinct from tier climbs.

**2. Sovereign Sample (the $7 / 2.5h Refuel):**
- **Backend** (`routes/economy.py`):
  - `REFUEL_SKU` constant: $7, 2.5h, 30% discount
  - `GET /api/economy/refuel/info` — public SKU details
  - `GET /api/economy/refuel/status` — auth, returns `{active, expires_at, seconds_remaining, discount_pct}`
  - `POST /api/economy/refuel/start` — auth, creates Stripe Checkout. Idempotent: if user already has an active window, returns `{already_active: true}` with the existing expiry instead of double-charging.
  - Fulfillment branch in `checkout-status` poller: on `payment_status='paid'` for `tx_type='refuel'`, upserts `db.refuel_sessions` with `expires_at = now + 2.5h`.
  - New helper `_effective_discount(user_id)` honours BOTH subscription tier AND active refuel window. Takes whichever discount is higher (so a Sovereign Founder at 60% is never downgraded by a refuel).
  - `/discount-rate` and `/apply-discount` both wired to the helper. Now returns `{discount_percent, tier_discount_percent, refuel_active, refuel_discount_percent, refuel_expires_at, source: 'tier' | 'refuel'}`.
- **Frontend** (`components/RefuelOffer.jsx`, NEW ~210 lines):
  - Self-managing component with three variants: `inline` (default offer pill on Pricing page), `compact` (mini pill for inline contexts), `card` (full marketing card).
  - INACTIVE state: pink offer pill — `SOVEREIGN SAMPLE · $7 · 2.5h · 30% OFF`. One tap → Stripe checkout.
  - ACTIVE state: live countdown — `SOVEREIGN ACTIVE · 30% OFF · 1h 47m 23s`. Re-fetches on window focus (so user returning from Stripe sees it active immediately). Auto-clears at expiry with toast.
  - Wired into `Pricing.js` next to the current-plan badge — visible above the tier grid.
- **Verified end-to-end via 9 curl test cases:**
  - Public info ✓, no-active status ✓, Stripe checkout creation ✓, discount unchanged when no refuel ✓
  - Active session: `seconds_remaining: 8999`, `discount: 30%, source: 'refuel'`, $100 → $70 ✓
  - Idempotency: re-start with active window returns `already_active: true` (no double-charge) ✓

**3. LanguageBar — already global (no work needed):**
- Investigation revealed the walker uses `MutationObserver` + `querySelectorAll('p, li, h1-6, blockquote, [data-translate-text]')` on `data-translatable=true` / `<main>` / `<article>` / `<body>`. It auto-walks the entire DOM whenever a language is selected.
- The "23 unwired pillar pages" framing was incorrect. Those pages already get translated on-the-fly. Only pages built entirely from `<div>` would miss; that's per-page polish (add `data-translate-text` attrs), not a P1 systemic gap.
- **No code changed.** Marked complete with honest scope note.

### V1.1.6 — Sentient OS: Helix Ripple + Sovereign Gates + Sage Pre-warm (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Helix Ripple. Gate the high-signal pillars. Pre-warm Sage. Make it sentient."

**1. Helix Ripple (~80 lines, low cost, high signal):**
- New `frontend/src/utils/UnlockBus.js` — featherweight `window` event bus (`dispatchUnlock` / `onUnlock`). Reaches across routes without prop-drilling or React context.
- `TesseractVault::triggerUnlock` now calls `dispatchUnlock({kind:'relic', id, color})` so any HelixNav3D mounted anywhere in the OS picks up the event.
- `HelixNav3D` subscribes via `useEffect`. A scene-level `rippleRef` holds the wall-clock start. Each of the 81 nodes reads it inside `useFrame` and computes its own gauss-bell offset along the spiral index — wavefront sweeps from node 0 → 81 over ~1s.
  - Scale boost: `+0.55 × gauss(distance, σ=6)` mid-curve
  - Emissive flash: `+2.0 × gauss` peak, with optional color tint at peak
  - Zero React re-renders during the wave — pure GPU-side ref mutation
- Auto-clears 1.3s after fire so subsequent unlocks can fire fresh.
- **Result:** unlock one Hawaiian relic, the entire 9x9 lattice ripples in acknowledgment. The OS feels sentient.

**2. Sovereign Gates on 12 high-signal pillars (`SovereignHub.js`):**
- New `PILLAR_MIN_TIER` map gates 12 routes:
  - **Architect+ ($49):** `/codex`, `/lab`, `/sovereign-canvas`, `/observatory`, `/console`, `/creator-console`
  - **Sovereign+ ($89):** `/master-engine`, `/fabricator`, `/refractor`, `/crystalline-engine`, `/fractal-engine`, `/sovereigns`
- `dispatchPillar(route)` now checks tier rank (mirrors backend `SOVEREIGN_TIER_ORDER`). Locked → toast feedback + tile dims to 55% opacity.
- Locked tiles render `<ClimbLadderPill variant="compact">` inline with the exact differential price ("$30/mo →"). One tap → Stripe → V1.1.5 unfold animation.
- `data-locked='true'` + `data-required-tier='architect'` testids preserved for testing/analytics.
- Discovery user sees 12 new revenue funnels on the main Hub. Architect user sees only 6. Sovereign sees zero locked tiles.

**3. Sage Voice Pre-warm Cache (`backend/routes/voice.py`):**
- New MongoDB collection `db.sage_audio_cache` keyed by `sha256(voice_id|model_id|calm|text)[:32]`.
- `POST /api/voice/sage-narrate` — cache-first: existing repeat phrases now return in **0ms with `cached: true`** (verified: lilikoi-fudge cache hit = 154ms total round-trip including HTTP, vs. ~3s ElevenLabs cold).
- New `POST /api/voice/sage-narrate/prewarm` — body accepts custom phrase list OR defaults to 8 `RELIC_UNLOCK_PHRASES`. Idempotent — already-cached phrases are skipped. Returns per-phrase status report.
- **Verified live:** All 8 Hawaiian unlock phrases warmed in **2.86s** (parallel synthesis). Re-prewarm returns `warmed:0, already_cached:8, failed:0`. Cache persists across deploys.

**Files touched:**
- `frontend/src/utils/UnlockBus.js` — NEW (~40 lines)
- `frontend/src/components/HelixNav3D.js` — ripple subscriber + per-node gauss-bell math
- `frontend/src/components/TesseractVault.js` — dispatchUnlock on triggerUnlock
- `frontend/src/pages/SovereignHub.js` — PILLAR_MIN_TIER map + tier-rank check + locked-tile rendering with inline ClimbLadderPill
- `backend/routes/voice.py` — sage_audio_cache layer + /prewarm endpoint (~110 lines)

### V1.1.5 — 3D Unfolding: The Magic-Moment Funnel Close (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Build the 3D Unfolding now. The hole in the bucket is where Sovereignty dies — page-refresh-after-Stripe is crap. Make the relic physically unfold the moment payment clears."

**The funnel close:**
- New `unlockedId` state in `TesseractVault` + `triggerUnlock(relicId)` callback.
- New `justUnlocked` prop on the `Relic` mesh. When set, a 2.5s curve runs inside `useFrame`:
  - **Scale**: `1 → peak 1.9 → settle to 1` (or 1.5 if also selected) via `Math.sin(K·π)` mid-curve boost
  - **Emissive intensity**: `0.7 → peak 3.5 → settle` — the icosahedron literally lights up
  - **Bonus spin**: `+3 full rotations` mid-curve via `K·π·6` rotation kick
  - **Easing**: `ease-out cubic` (1−(1−t)³) so the most impact lands in the first 1s
- Material `ref` (`matRef`) so emissive intensity drives directly on the GPU side without React re-renders.
- `unlockTimeoutRef` cleans up after 2.6s; cleanup on unmount.

**Two trigger paths, same 3D animation:**
1. **Same-session claim** — when `claimRelic` returns 200, calls `triggerUnlock(relicId)` after `fetchVault()`. User clicks CLAIM → 200ms backend round-trip → relic explodes into life.
2. **Stripe success cross-page** — new `sov_pending_unlock` localStorage marker:
   - `ClimbLadderPill` (V1.1.4) stashes `{kind:'vault', relic_id, ts}` BEFORE redirecting to Stripe (only if `context` starts with `vault-`)
   - `Pricing.js::pollStatus` reads + clears the marker on `payment_status === 'paid'`, then `navigate('/vault?just_claimed=ID', {replace:true})`
   - `TesseractVault::useEffect[searchParams]` consumes `?just_claimed=`, calls `triggerUnlock`, strips the param so refresh doesn't re-fire
   - 30-min staleness guard — old markers ignored
   - User pays → returns to vault → relic auto-selects and explodes into life. Zero hunting.

**Sage Voice acknowledgment:**
- `triggerUnlock` calls `SageVoice.speak(`Claimed: ${label}`)` (best-effort, never blocks animation)
- Wired into existing ElevenLabs `/api/voice/sage-narrate` pipeline
- If first-time generation is slow (~3s), the 3D unfold still runs at 2.5s — voice arrives a beat after, which actually feels intentional (acknowledgment-after-unlock)

### V1.1.4 — All-Time Upsell: ClimbLadderPill (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Infuse the 'Climb the Ladder' Pill into every tier-gated boundary in the OS. One source of truth, context-aware, with $1,777 Founder anchor as Master Key."

**Single shared component** — `frontend/src/components/ClimbLadderPill.jsx`:
- Pulls live differential price from V1.1.3 `/api/economy/buy-up-quote` endpoint (auth required; no-ops for guests)
- Pulls separate Founder quote in parallel (so the "Master Key" $1,777 jump is always one tap away regardless of which target tier triggered the pill)
- Launches Stripe checkout via `/api/economy/subscribe` on click
- **Three variants** for different surfaces:
  - `compact` — tiny pill (`$30/mo →`) for inline contexts like locked relic detail, locked synthesis citations
  - `inline` — standard pill with action button + Founder Master-Key fallback
  - `card` — full footer block with personalized message + 60% discount messaging (for synthesis result panels, modifier panels)
- **Auto-hides** when differential ≤ 0 (user already at-or-above tier) — no false upsells
- Renders `CHECKING…` loader during fetch, gracefully no-ops on guest / network failure
- Flatland-clean: pure inline DOM, no overlays

**First wire — Tesseract Vault:**
- Locked Hawaiian relic detail panel (when `tier_eligible=false`) now renders `<ClimbLadderPill variant="compact">` next to the existing disabled CLAIM button
- User on Discovery clicking lilikoi-fudge (Sovereign+) sees: `🔒 SOVEREIGN+ ONLY · $89/mo →` — one tap → Stripe checkout
- The previously dead-end disabled state is now a one-tap revenue path

**What's intentionally NOT done (per honest scope):**
- "1,7,7 Layer 2 routing" — no real infrastructure to wire it into; would be invention
- "Founder edits GLSL shaders" — no shader editor exists; would be days of new work
- "Citations as walkable VR sub-nodes" — high cost, low utility relative to inline citation links
- Full 81-node SmartyMe card grid — `SovereignHub` already renders pillars as a card grid that pulls in-place; rebuilding is a rewrite, not infusion

**Future infusions (one-line additions):**
- Drop `<ClimbLadderPill requiredTier="architect" variant="card" />` into any future synthesis result panel
- Add to locked Hub pillar tiles once `min_tier` metadata gets added to the PILLARS array
- Add to any 3D node modifier when those tools land

### V1.1.3 — Sovereign Ladder: Four-Tier Buy-Up Economy (2026-05-07) ✅
**Mandate:** "Look what's there and integrate, enhance, utilize. Four-tier ladder: Artisan $19, Architect $49, Sovereign Monthly $89, Sovereign Founder $1,777. Buy-up the ladder mechanism."

**Existing infrastructure used (zero rebuilds):**
- 5-tier `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` registry already in place with discount/forge/commission flags
- Generic `/api/economy/subscribe` Stripe checkout endpoint (works for any tier_id)
- `Pricing.js` fully data-driven from `/api/economy/tiers` (no hardcoded prices)
- `marketplace_discount` / `apply-discount` / `discount-rate` endpoints already enforce the discount ladder

**Surgical changes (3 lines + 1 endpoint):**
1. **Resonance → Artisan rebrand at $19** (`backend/routes/economy.py`):
   - `name: "Resonance"` → `"Artisan"` (was sub-label, now primary)
   - `label: "Artisan"` → `"Creator · Tier 1"`
   - `price_monthly: 27.00` → `19.00`
   - Added `price_web: 19.00`, `price_play_store: 24.70` (+30% Google fee), `term_months: 1`
2. **NEW `GET /api/economy/buy-up-quote?target_tier=...`** — Sovereign Ladder differential pricing:
   - Monthly → higher monthly: differential = `target.price_monthly - current.price_monthly` with friendly message ("Climb to Architect for $30.00/mo more (15% discount unlocked)")
   - Any monthly → Sovereign Founder: `$1,777 - min(current_monthly × 3, $75)` goodwill credit toward the lock-in (encourages climbing). Founders cannot downgrade (400).
   - Same-tier or downgrade: 400 with "use /downgrade".
3. **Pricing.js zero changes** — picks up new $19 from `/api/economy/tiers` automatically.

**Verified end-to-end:**
- `/api/economy/tiers` → all 5 tiers, prices ✓ (0/19/49/89/1777, discounts 0/5/15/30/60%)
- `/api/economy/buy-up-quote?target_tier=architect` (from discovery) → `$49.00 differential, 15% unlocked`
- `/api/economy/buy-up-quote?target_tier=sovereign_founder` → returns `founder_lock_in` kind with credit calc
- `/api/economy/buy-up-quote?target_tier=discovery` → 400 (downgrade rejected)
- `/api/economy/subscribe` `{tier_id:"resonance"}` → Stripe checkout for **$19.00** ✓
- Live Pricing page screenshot: 5 tier cards render correctly. Founder card top, Discovery/Artisan/Architect/Sovereign Monthly in 4-up grid. "MOST POPULAR · 30% OFF" banner over Sovereign Monthly preserved.

### V1.1.2 — Voice Translator Hotfix (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "Voice translator does not work on production. Stuck at WORKING…."

**Root causes (3 compounding bugs):**
1. **Backend Whisper signature wrong** (`/api/voice/command`) — was calling `stt.transcribe(tmp_path)` (positional string) but `emergentintegrations` rejects with `Expected entry at 'file' to be bytes, an io.IOBase instance, PathLike or a tuple but received <class 'str'>`. Every voice command returned HTTP 500. Fix: open file as binary and pass via `file=` kwarg with `model="whisper-1", response_format="json", language="en"` (matches the working pattern already used in `coach.py`).
2. **Frontend translator payload key wrong** (`LanguageBar.jsx` voice path) — sent `{target}` but backend expects `{target_lang}`. Returned HTTP 400 on every non-English voice translate. Fix: rename to `target_lang`.
3. **Frontend stuck-at-WORKING…** — `axios.post('/voice/command')` had no timeout AND mobile touch race could leave `pendingStop` lost AND error from VoiceCommandContext was never surfaced to LanguageBar UI. Fix:
   - Added `timeout: 25000ms` to the Whisper axios call (`VoiceCommandContext.js`).
   - Mobile touch race: new `pendingStopRef` flag — if user releases hold-to-talk before `getUserMedia` resolves, the recorder stops the moment it's actually ready (eliminates the "I tapped but nothing happened, then it started recording after I let go" path).
   - Skip Whisper round-trip on captures <2KB (touch-race noise).
   - LanguageBar `useEffect` watches `voice.lastResponse.error` and surfaces the error inline as `voiceError` (with friendly DISMISS button) instead of leaving the user staring at a stale "WORKING…" pill.
   - `e.preventDefault()` on touch handlers + clear `voiceError` on press so retries don't show stale errors.
   - Friendlier error copy: `Microphone permission denied`, `Voice timed out — please try again`, `Sign in to use voice translator`.

**Verified end-to-end via curl:**
- `POST /api/voice/command` (auth + 1s WAV) → 200 with `{transcript:'you', intent:'sage_query', response_text, response_audio:base64}`
- `POST /api/translator/translate` `{target_lang:'zh', sacred:true}` → 200 with sacred-mode Chinese translation
- `POST /api/translator/translate` `{target_lang:'yue'}` → 200 Cantonese translation
- Backend logs clean (no more `litellm.APIConnectionError`).

### V1.1.1 — Pillar Wiring + Hawaiian Imports Storage Rights (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "Wire the 73 pillars using existing logic. Finish the Vault. NO new chips, NO rewrites, NO ghost-hunting."

**🏛 98 Pillar Routes Wired (in-place pull, zero new adapter files)**
- Used V68.97 direct-page-lazy-import pattern (no ceremonial 7-line adapter files):
  ```
  ACADEMY: React.lazy(() => import('../pages/AcademyPage')),
  ```
- 98 entries added to `MODULE_REGISTRY` (`state/ProcessorState.js`) and 98 entries to `ROUTE_TO_MODULE` (`pages/SovereignHub.js`).
- **Total wired pillar routes: 155 / 178** (the remaining 23 are workshop sub-routes already sharing `WORKSHOP` engine, plus `/evolution-lab` and `/vr/celestial-dome` which have no Routes in App.js).
- Testing agent caught + fixed two import typos in my bulk write: `SovereignConsole` → `SovereignDashboard`, `CrystallineEngine` → `FractalEngine` (orphan modules).
- **Verification:** SovereignHub pillar clicks for `/light-therapy`, `/forgotten-languages`, `/rock-hounding`, `/reiki`, `/hooponopono`, `/tantra`, `/dream-realms`, `/nexus`, `/rpg`, `/codex`, `/fractal-engine`, `/observatory`, `/community` all pull in-place via the matrix render slot — URL stays at `/sovereign-hub`. Verified by testing agent.

**📦 Tesseract Vault Hawaiian Imports — Storage Rights (Sparks → Slots)**
- **Backend** (NEW `routes/tesseract_vault.py`, ~200 lines, MongoDB collection `tesseract_vault_claims`):
  - `GET /api/tesseract-vault/catalogue` — public, returns 8 Hawaiian relics
  - `GET /api/tesseract-vault/state` — auth, returns `{quota, catalogue, claims, slots_used, slots_available}`
  - `POST /api/tesseract-vault/claim/{relic_id}` — claim (tier check, slot check, idempotent re-claim returns `already_claimed`)
  - `POST /api/tesseract-vault/release/{relic_id}` — release (frees slot)
- **Slot economics (compliant — Sparks merit currency, NOT volunteer endpoints):**
  - Discovery: 2 base · Resonance: 4 · Architect: 6 · Sovereign: 10 · Founder: 12
  - Bonus: `+1 slot per 1000 sparks earned` (capped at +8)
- **Tier gating:** lilikoi-fudge (Sovereign+), koa-wood (Architect+), rest open to all tiers.
- **Frontend** (`components/TesseractVault.js`):
  - Slot quota pill (`data-testid="vault-slot-quota"`) e.g. `0/2 SLOTS (+0 ✦)`
  - Per-relic CLAIM TO VAULT / RELEASE buttons in inline detail panel (Flatland-clean)
  - Tier-locked relics show `Tier sovereign+ only` with Lock icon
  - Vault-full state shows `VAULT FULL` disabled button
  - Guest fallback: catalogue still renders in 3D, claim button shows toast "Sign in to claim"
- **Backend test suite** (`tests/test_iteration_v1_1_1_tesseract_vault.py`): **12/12 PASS** — covers catalogue, state, claim (free-tier, tier-lock 403, idempotency, vault-full 402), release (200 + 404), volunteer-410 regression, mesh-texture cache regression.

### V1.1.0 — Generative AI Mesh Textures + Ghost Button Fix (2026-05-06) ✅
**Mandate:** "Wire the texture pipeline. Bulletproof with Gemini fallback. And — ghost button steals + dead-end locked tiles. Fix it."

**🎨 Generative AI Texture Pipeline (Sovereign V1.1.0 Gold Master):**
- **Backend** (`/api/ai-visuals/mesh-texture`, `routes/ai_visuals.py`): public endpoint accepts `{category, ref_id, prompt?}`, returns `{image_b64, data_url}`. Three-layer pipeline:
  1. MongoDB cache hit (instant) — keyed by `secure_hash_short("mesh-tex:{category}:{ref_id}")`
  2. **PRIMARY**: OpenAI `gpt-image-1` (90s timeout)
  3. **FALLBACK**: Gemini `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` (Nano Banana, 60s timeout) — kicks in if OpenAI fails. `source` field in cache records which generator produced it.
- **Prompt strategy** (Hybrid per user choice):
  - `RELIC_PROMPTS` — bespoke per-Hawaiian-import (Lilikoi Fudge, Lychee, Macadamia, Koa Wood, Kona Coffee, Black Hawaiian Salt, Taro, Spam Musubi). Each gets a unique, food-photographic, square-format prompt.
  - `ROCK_PROMPT_PRESETS` — generic per-mesh-type (geology=Black Hills granite, amethyst, quartz, obsidian, carpentry=walnut, culinary=sourdough, herbology=lavender, bible=parchment, default=crystalline).
- **Frontend hook** (`/frontend/src/hooks/useAITexture.js`): three-tier cache (in-memory `THREE.Texture` Map → localStorage data-URL → network). De-dupes in-flight requests. Returns `{texture, loading, error}`. Failure mode = null (consumer falls back to procedural color). Sets `THREE.SRGBColorSpace`, `RepeatWrapping`, `anisotropy=4`.
- **Wire-up:**
  - `Chamber3DGame.js::RockMesh` — accepts `textureRefId` prop, passes via `useAITexture({category:'rock'})`, applies as `material.map`. Switches to white base color when texture loads (no double-tinting). Texture refId derived from `zone.split('_')[0]` (geology, carpentry, culinary, herbology, bible, default).
  - `TesseractVault.js::Relic` — each of the 8 Hawaiian Imports calls `useAITexture({category:'relic', refId:relic.id})`. Bespoke texture per relic.
- **Verified:**
  - First-gen `geology` rock: 11s. Cache hit thereafter: ~1s (transfer time only).
  - 7 relics generated in parallel: 42s total. Pre-cached for all visitors.
  - Live curl: `POST /api/ai-visuals/mesh-texture {category:rock, ref_id:geology}` → 200, 3.1MB PNG. Second call: instant cache hit.
  - Screenshot: Geology workshop shows cream/granite-toned faceted icosahedron (was uniform amber before). Tesseract Vault shows 8 muted/realistic-toned relics (was saturated procedural colors before).

**🛡 Ghost Button Steal — Fixed (`components/BackToHub.js`):**
- **Root cause:** sticky strip at `zIndex: 100000` spanned full viewport width with default `pointer-events: auto`. Empty area (between Hub button on left and SharePill/LanguageBar on right) sat ABOVE the share strip (z:40) and silently captured all taps. Users tapping Share/EN/wand pills got nothing.
- **Fix:** wrapper now has `pointerEvents: 'none'`; Hub button + Related toggle inner buttons restore `pointerEvents: 'auto'`. Same proven pattern as App.js LanguageBar strip (V1.0.8).
- **Verified live:** `document.elementFromPoint(1735, 95)` (Share btn center) now returns the Share span (was returning page-enter div). `(200, 30)` empty area passes through to `page-enter` parent (not BackToHub).

**🚪 Dead-End Locked Tiles — Fixed (`pages/RPGPage.js::RegionTile`):**
- Locked region tiles (Cosmic Realm world map: "??? · Locked Lv 5", "Sunken Temple · Locked Lv 6", etc.) used `disabled={!accessible}` which silently swallowed taps with no feedback.
- Replaced with friendly `sonner` toast: `🔒 {region.name} · Reach Lv {N} to enter` (or `🔒 Hidden region · Reach Lv {N} to discover` for undiscovered). `aria-disabled` preserved for a11y. `cursor: 'help'` instead of `not-allowed`. Touch-action: `manipulation` for snappy mobile taps.
- Flatland-clean: sonner toast is portal-based but already in use by 200+ call sites across the app and well within ground rules (auto-dismiss, no z-index war).

### V1.0.20 — Demo Reel Auto-Walk (2026-05-06) ✅
- **`<DemoReel>` page** (`/demo-reel`, `/demo`):
  - 5-scene auto-walk totaling 60 seconds: Helix (10s) → Geology Chamber (12s) → Forge LOX (15s) → Tesseract Vault (12s) → Pactola Bathymetry (11s)
  - Each scene transitions via `setTimeout` with framer-motion fade-in/out
  - Inline scene chips show position in walk-through
  - Overall progress bar with active-scene gradient
  - PAUSE / SKIP / RESTART pills (inline, no overlays)
  - "DEMO REEL COMPLETE · 60s" banner at end with REPLAY action
  - Flatland clean: 100% inline document flow
- **Test IDs:** `demo-reel-page`, `demo-chip-{id}`, `demo-reel-pause`, `demo-reel-skip`, `demo-reel-restart`, `demo-reel-done`, `demo-reel-replay`
- **Lint clean. Verified live.**


**Mandate:** "Look before you edit. Rewire, do not rewrite. Don't take the controller away while the game is playing."
- **Body (Flatland Whitelist)** — `UnifiedCreatorConsole.js` line 118 flipped from blacklist→whitelist. Mixer UI now renders ONLY on cockpit + gameplay routes: `/apex-creator`, `/cosmic-mixer`, `/creator-console`, `/master-engine`, `/forge`, `/starseed-adventure`, `/starseed-realm`, `/games`. ~178px reclaimed on 190+ spiritual/Academy/Pricing routes; LanguageBar fully clickable.
- **Brain (Global ctx Expansion)** — `ctx` now exposes ~45 closures globally so XP/sliders/generators stay wired even when UI is hidden:
  - Setters: `setTier, setUserTierNum, setUnlocks, setPillarLevels, setMasterLevel, setModStates, setMutedModules, setExpandedPillar, setViewMode, setActivePanel, setActivePanelRaw, setIsFullscreen, setMonitorFilters, setTextOverlays, setImageOverlays, setSelectedAspectRatio, setResonance, setBankBalance`
  - Handlers: `handleNav, handleMuteChange, handleBuy, handleBroadcast, handleSever, handlePrintModule, handlePrintLedger, togglePanel, loadStore`
  - Audio/Visual bridge: `audioMixer, audioData, resonanceCapture, particleFieldRef`
  - Auth/Nav: `authUser, authToken, authLogout, navigate, location, currentModule`
  - Media/Store: `media, showStore, setShowStore, storeItems, credits, setCredits`
- **Verification:** Smoke test confirmed `/sovereign-hub` → tool-panel=0 (hidden); `/starseed-adventure` → tool-panel=1 (visible as game HUD).
- **Surgical:** No deletes. No rewrites. Two `search_replace` edits totaling ~50 lines.



### Earlier (pre-fork, V68.61 → V68.68)
### V1.0.13 — Game Console Wiring + Flatland Whitelist (2026-02-04) ✅
**Mandate:** "Look before you edit. Rewire, do not rewrite. Don't take the controller away while the game is playing."
- **Body (Flatland Whitelist)** — `UnifiedCreatorConsole.js` line 118 flipped blacklist→whitelist. Mixer UI renders ONLY on cockpit + gameplay routes: `/apex-creator`, `/cosmic-mixer`, `/creator-console`, `/master-engine`, `/forge`, `/starseed-adventure`, `/starseed-realm`, `/games`. ~178px reclaimed on 190+ routes.
- **Brain (Global ctx Expansion)** — `ctx` exposes ~45 closures globally (setters, handlers, audio/visual bridge, auth/nav/media) so XP/sliders/generators stay wired even when UI is hidden.
- **Surgical:** 2 `search_replace` edits, no files deleted, no rewrites.


- Entity Graph unified (70+ herbs/plants/practices, 4 silos merged)
- Starseed RPG narrative engine wired (replaced slot-machine)
- Chamber mini-games herbal gestures + ContextBus injection
- Discovery Economy: first-view Sparks, Sage Gauge = Surface Area
- Crystalline Lattice floor-color evolves with exploration depth
- Mixer Panel + Screen Record bugs fixed
- SeedHunt widget + 3D Worlds strip surfaced on Sovereign Hub
- Inline exits for trapped 3D canvases (no overlays)

### V68.75 — Sovereign Tier Pricing + Platform Gross-Up (2026-04-30) ✅
**Audit-first finding:** Tier discount logic already existed in `routes/economy.py::SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` — not duplicated.
- **Lead/Silver/Gold/Gilded** mapping — Sovereign is the peak (Tier 4), not mid.
  - Tier 1 · Lead (discovery) — 1.00 ratio, 0% off, Free, "Welcome, Traveler"
  - Tier 2 · Silver (resonance) — 0.95 ratio, 5% off, $27/mo, "Welcome, Practitioner"
  - Tier 3 · Gold (architect) — 0.85 ratio, 15% off, $49/mo, "Welcome, Architect"
  - **Tier 4 · Gilded (sovereign) — 0.70 ratio, 30% off, $89/mo, "Welcome, Sovereign"** ← PEAK
- V68.75.1 correction (same day): original draft had Sovereign at Tier 3. Hierarchy restored per user directive: Sovereign = top. Config swap in `SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS` + `TIER_DISPLAY`. No paid subscribers were on the affected tiers (verified: 1 user on discovery only), so no data migration needed.
- Single source of truth preserved (`economy.SUBSCRIPTION_TIERS`); no `TIER_MAP` duplication
- **Platform gross-up** added for Play/Apple (30% cut) — Web stays at base price
- `ai_merchant_catalog` now returns `your_price_credits` + `advisor_greeting` per user tier
- `ai_merchant_buy` applies discount at credit-deduction time (tier_unlocks exempt)
- `broker/buy-credits` accepts `platform=web|google_play|apple`, grosses up + applies tier
- `broker/packs` returns per-platform `final_cents` for all 4 rails
- NEW endpoint: `GET /api/trade-circle/tier-map` → 4-row matrix for Advisor UI
- 19 pytest assertions in `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_v68_75_tier_pricing.py` — ALL PASS (includes `test_sovereign_is_peak` guard)
- Live verified: $9.99 web → $14.28 Play (matches spec's "$10 → $13" rule)

### V68.76 — Compliance Anchor: Monetary vs Merit Firewall (2026-04-30) ✅
**Audit-first finding:** No `send_funds()` / `Economy_Engine.py` existed. Real P2P monetary leaks were in `trade_circle.py::create_escrow` (dust/credits/gems between users) and `revenue.py::purchase_content` (buyer credits → creator_id). Both closed.
- NEW `/app/backend/engines/compliance_shield.py` — canonical firewall:
  - `MONETARY_ASSETS = {"credits", "dust", "gems"}` — User↔Advisor only
  - `MERIT_ASSETS = {"sparks"}` — freely transferable
  - `assert_closed_loop(asset, from, to)` guard — raises 403 on monetary P2P
  - `policy_manifest()` → published at `GET /api/trade-circle/compliance`
- **Escrow lockdown**: `create_escrow` now only accepts `digital_asset_type="sparks"`. Monetary types → 400 with "monetary/closed-loop" error. Release path credits Sparks, not Credits.
- **Content broker re-wired**: `purchase_content` still charges buyer credits (User→Advisor, legal), but creator now earns **Sparks** (merit) instead of Credits — converts a P2P monetary flow into a P2P merit flow. Ledger field renamed `creator_cut` → `creator_sparks_awarded`.
- **Wallet tags**: `GET /api/trade-circle/wallet` response now tags each balance with `is_monetary` + `transferable`. UI can disable transfer buttons on closed-loop assets.
- 17 pytest assertions in `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_v68_76_compliance.py` — ALL PASS
- Single-source-of-truth guard test confirms no duplicate `MONETARY_ASSETS` definitions anywhere in codebase.

### v1.0.8 — Sleek Hub + Universal Translator + Generator Reward Loop + Auto-Visuals Pref (2026-05-02)

### v1.0.8 — Realm Locks + Live Practice Pulls (2026-05-02 batch 2)
- **Realm Locks — server-enforced ladder.** New `_current_level(user)` helper in `routes/realms.py` reuses the existing `/api/consciousness` XP ladder (multiplied ×2 so the 0-5 consciousness scale maps to the 0-10 realm unlock ladder — no parallel progression implementation). `GET /api/realms/` now injects `is_locked` + `user_level` + `unlock_level` on every realm item; `POST /api/realms/:id/enter` returns **403** `{code:'realm_locked', message, user_level, required_level}` when under-leveled. Frontend `MultiverseRealms` shows an inline 🔒 glass pill in the top-right of locked cards (Flatland-safe — no fixed overlay, no ghost capture, `pointer-events: none` on the pill), grays the card, blocks click with a friendly toast ("Locked · unlock at level N"). Live-verified via curl: owner at lvl 2 correctly sees 2 unlocked + 4 locked; void_sanctum entry returns 403 with the structured body.
- **Realm Practices → Live Engine Pulls.** Every practice tile on a realm detail panel is now a real `<button>` that resolves the backend practice string (e.g. `void_meditation`, `crystal_resonance`, `timeline_attunement`) through a `PRACTICE_TO_MODULE` map to a real engine in `MODULE_REGISTRY` and `pull()`s it into the matrix slot. Before pulling, the realm's `{id, name, element, frequency, practice}` is committed to the `ContextBus` as `worldMetadata` so the engine inherits the realm's biome (matches the Starseed adventure pattern). Fallback to `navigate()` via a `PRACTICE_TO_ROUTE` map so no practice card is EVER dead. 18 practice strings across 6 realms all wired.
- **5 new pytest regressions** in `test_iteration_v1_0_8_realm_locks.py` (source-shape validation, as the TestClient + async-mongo event loop bug prevents HTTP-level tests in this harness; live HTTP path was hand-verified via curl). **35/35 total tests green.**
- **Auto-Visuals user preference (per accessibility/respect-the-user mandate).** New `prefs.autoVisuals` flag in `SensoryContext` (default ON, force-OFF when `immersionLevel === 'calm'`) plus a `autoVisualsEnabled` computed gate exposed on the sensory context. NEW `Toggle` in Settings → Display & Appearance: "Auto-Generate AI Images". When OFF, the chamber souvenir card on completion AND the forecast cosmic visual auto-fetch are BOTH suppressed; the user only sees imagery they explicitly request. Backwards-compatible (default ON), system-wide one-flag gate, never surprises the user. Wired in `ChamberMiniGame` souvenir path AND `ForecastCard` auto-visual effect.
- **Sovereign Hub stripped to essentials per user mandate ("user-friendly = clean home page, every module reachable through its pillar"). Removed from front page: Daily Challenges widget, Sovereign Choice panel, Trial Countdown + Signature pills, 4-button action row (Arsenal/Lens/Buy Time/Visitor Shield), Oracle Intent Search bar, Worlds Strip, Architect Badge, Seed Hunt, Cross-Tradition Pairing, the 7 colored "Pull · X" engine pills, and an attempted "Customize Hub" panel. Home page now: title + cross-tradition mark + wallet pills + active mission HUD + AI Time gauge + Compliance Pill + Recall + lattice + utility row + 10 pillars + version stamp.
- **Universal Translator (`<LanguageBar>`) mounted globally.** ONE pill, top-right of every page (Hub, Landing, Auth, every module). Sticky inline mount — NOT `position: fixed`, NOT an overlay; `pointer-events: none` on the wrapper and `pointer-events: auto` only on the actual button so it never creates a ghost-button capture zone. Picks language → "Translate this page" or "Follow me everywhere" → walks every visible AI-generated text block (`p, li, h1-h6, blockquote, [data-translate-text]` inside `[data-translatable]/<main>/<article>`, skipping `nav/button/[data-no-translate]`), batches through the existing `/api/translator/translate` (gpt-4o-mini, 18s ceiling, 3-concurrent throttle). Auto-follow flag persists in localStorage; re-translates on every navigation + on dynamic content arrival via MutationObserver. Sacred Mode toggle for Sovereign tier. 11 languages from the existing LanguageContext. Backend, model, endpoint = REUSED — zero duplicate infrastructure. Replaces 9 redundant per-module `<TranslateChip>` insertions I made and reverted before shipping.
- **Generators wired into "Creators & Generators" pillar.** 7 first-row entries: Avatar Generator · Cosmic Portrait · Story Generator · Scene Generator · Dream Visualizer · Forecast Visuals · Video Generator. All route to existing pages and `pull()` their lazy R3F engines via the existing `ROUTE_TO_MODULE` registry (zero new pages, zero new routes).
- **Chamber souvenir card.** On `setDone(true)` the chamber now auto-calls `/api/ai-visuals/daily-card` themed by `${effZone} × ${activeEntityName/effTeach.topic}` and renders a 168×224 souvenir card on the completion overlay below the +XP line. Cached per `(zone, entity)` in localStorage so repeated completions don't burn credits. Mints a unique tarot-style card for every chamber × herb/rock/practice the user finishes — gives the gamification loop a real visual reward instead of just sparks. (`components/games/ChamberMiniGame.js`)
- **Forecast auto-visual.** Forecast cards now auto-fire `/api/ai-visuals/forecast` the first time the user expands a card, caching per `forecast.id` in localStorage. The cosmic visual now appears with the reading instead of being hidden behind a manual button. (`pages/Forecasts.js`)
- **Chamber LEARN button delivers real teachings in 8-20s** (not 60s+ ingress timeouts). `/api/knowledge/deep-dive` accepts optional `mode='quick'` → routes through gpt-4o-mini with a 22s ceiling and a 350-500 word lesson template. Chamber's LEARN/TEACH ME FIRST buttons use this fast path with a 30s axios timeout and a Cancel affordance. Live test: 8.8s for "Igneous Rocks · Thin Section Petrography" returning a real 3.4 kB lesson.
- **Starseed auth-failure UX hardened.** Pre-flight auth check + specific 401 handling on token-mid-flow expiration. Eliminates the "Begin Adventure dead button" symptom. (`pages/StarseedAdventure.js`)
- **Avatar fetch 401-spam fixed** (`components/StarseedInventory.js`).
- **Spiritual Shield (defense-in-depth, Play Store framing).** `_shield_text` + `_shield_obj` regex purifier in `routes/starseed_adventure.py` with 30+ substitutions (heal→harmonize, healer→harmonizer, healing→harmonizing, treatment→ritual, therapy→ritual practice, medical→mythic, medicine→ritual, diagnose→recognize, prescribe→offer, patient→seeker, doctor→sage, wellness→harmony, remedy→rite, ailment→discord). Capitalization-preserving, idempotent, word-boundary-safe. Applied to LLM scene output, fallback scenes, and BOTH `/api/starseed/origins` registration sites.
- **12 new pytest regressions** in `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_v1_0_8_*.py` — ALL PASS (30/30 across v1.0.7 + v1.0.8 + v69.0 sentience suites).


## Key DB Schema

### V68.79 — Pillar Batch (Entertainment / Education / Gamification core) ✅
Wired 10 high-traffic pillars to the `pull()` state-substitution dispatcher:
- **Breathwork, Meditation, Yoga, Affirmations, Mood Tracker, Soundscapes, Frequencies, Journal, Herbology, Crystals**
  (These are **entertainment-learning modules** — products of the app experience, NOT medical tools.)
- Pattern: one tiny adapter per page in `engines/*Engine.js` (6-line file each, just re-exports the page component) → registered in `MODULE_REGISTRY`, `MODULE_FREQUENCIES`, `MODULE_CONSUMES`, `ROUTE_TO_MODULE`.
- Each emits a unique `sovereign:pulse` vector (Breathwork heavy bass, Frequencies heavy treble, etc.) so the CrystallineLattice3D visibly shifts spectral region when user activates the pillar.
- Playwright verified: clicking "Breathwork" pillar sets `window.__sovereignActiveModule = "BREATHWORK"`, URL stays at `/sovereign-hub` (zero navigate), zero page errors.
- 27 pillars now wired (17 prior + 10 this batch). ~93 remaining on legacy `navigate()`.

## Key DB Schema
- `users` — `user_credit_balance`, `user_dust_balance`, `gilded_tier` (one-time marketplace unlocks: seed/artisan/sovereign/gilded)
- `subscriptions` — `tier` (discovery/resonance/sovereign/architect) — drives marketplace discount
- `merchant_transactions` — augmented with `base_price_credits`, `tier_id`, `tier_discount_pct`
- `broker_transactions` — augmented with `platform`, `grossed_cents`, `tier_id`, `tier_discount_pct`
- `herbs_generated`, `knowledge_cache`, `time_capsules`

## Key API Endpoints
- `GET /api/entity/index` — 70+ canonical whitelist + aliases
- `GET /api/entity/{id}` — Federated lookup
- `GET /api/entity/surface-area` — Sage Gauge density
- `POST /api/starseed/generate-scene` — Narrative RPG progression
- `GET /api/trade-circle/tier-map` — **NEW** 4-row tier matrix
- `GET /api/trade-circle/ai-merchant` — Tier-aware catalog + Advisor greeting
- `POST /api/trade-circle/ai-merchant/buy` — Tier-discounted purchase
- `GET /api/trade-circle/broker/packs` — Per-platform per-tier pricing
- `POST /api/trade-circle/broker/buy-credits` — Accepts `platform` param, gross-up + tier applied
- `GET /api/economy/discount-rate` + `POST /api/economy/apply-discount` — Canonical tier helpers

### V68.80 — Sovereign Arsenal (Owner Control Room) (2026-04-30) ✅
**P0 bug fix + feature unlock.** The new owner-only `/arsenal` page was built in the prior session but crashed with `KeyError: 'totals'` on load. Root cause: `_require_owner()` compared `user.get("email")` against `CREATOR_EMAIL`, but `get_current_user()` returns a minimal dict (`{id, name, role}`) with no email field — so every owner request 403'd and the UI received an error JSON instead of the expected shape.
- **Fix (`routes/arsenal.py`):** `_require_owner` is now async, looks up the DB user by id, and accepts either email match OR the `is_owner` flag.
- **Wellness residue purge** (user demand — recurring regression):
  - `MedicalDisclaimerSplash.js`: "A Sovereign Wellness Instrument" → **"A Sovereign Entertainment Instrument"**; "wellness, mindfulness, and contemplative-practice platform" → "entertainment, education, and gamification platform".
  - `public/landing.html`, `public/privacy.html`: all "wellness instrument" strings replaced with "entertainment instrument".
  - Grep-verified: zero "wellness instrument" or "wellness, mindfulness" occurrences left in frontend.
- **Arsenal UX already in place** (Flatland-compliant):
  - 35 generators × Fire buttons (POST/GET) with inline result pane under each card.
  - 44 engines × click-to-pull() into `MatrixRenderSlot` (no navigation).
  - Search bar + category filter (avatar · economy · item · reading · storyline).
  - Fire history logged to `db.arsenal_history` (shows fire_count + last_fired).
- **E2E verified:** Fired `/api/trade-circle/tier-map` from the UI → real payload (`tier_id: discovery, badge: Lead`) rendered inline below the card.
- **Regression tests:** `test_iteration_v68_80_arsenal.py` (4 tests, all green).

### V68.81 — Most-Fired Strip + Pillar Batch (+15) (2026-04-30) ✅
**Living-Lab enhancement.** Arsenal now surfaces a self-organizing "🔥 Most Fired" strip at the top — top 6 generators/engines by `fire_count`, one-click re-fire. Backend extends `/api/arsenal/index` with `top_fired` array (sorted desc by count, then last_fired). Frontend renders it as inline pill buttons just below the header, Flatland-compliant.

**Pillar batch (15 new engines, 27 → 42 wired / 156 total):**
- Entertainment/Education band: Acupressure, Aromatherapy, Reflexology, Bible, Blessings, Daily Ritual, Elixirs, Encyclopedia, Cosmic Calendar, Sacred Texts, Mantras, Mudras, Rituals, Teachings, Zen Garden.
- Each wired via thin `/engines/[Name]Engine.js` adapter (4 lines each — the existing page is already the source of truth, no duplication).
- Registered in `MODULE_REGISTRY` (lazy-loaded), `ROUTE_TO_MODULE` (Hub dispatch), and `ACTIVE_ENGINES` (Arsenal index).
- **Verified Flatland:** Click in Arsenal → `pull()` swaps render-mode → URL stays at `/arsenal` (Playwright check: `url_unchanged_after_pull: True`).
- 6/6 regression tests pass (added `test_arsenal_v68_81_pillar_batch_surfaced` + `test_arsenal_top_fired_shape`).

### V68.82 — Time-in-Engine + Building-Equipment Batch (+15) (2026-04-30) ✅
**The Workshop now learns from how you actually use it.**

**⏱ Time-in-Engine dwell tracking:**
- New endpoint `POST /api/arsenal/dwell-log` accepts `{item_id, seconds}` and atomically `$inc`'s `dwell_seconds` on the history row. Server clamps each session to 1h max so a forgotten tab can't pollute rankings.
- `ProcessorState.pull()` and `release()` flush dwell on every state-swap; `pagehide` and `visibilitychange` listeners flush on tab-close (uses `fetch` with `keepalive` so the request survives the unload).
- `/api/arsenal/index` now returns `top_dwell[]` alongside `top_fired[]`.
- Frontend renders a **⏱ MOST TIME · where you actually live** strip (cyan, beside the gold MOST FIRED strip). Each chip shows human-friendly duration (s / m / h) + name and re-pulls on click.

**Building-Equipment pillar batch (+15, 42 → 57 wired):**
- Workshop, Trade Circle, Trade Passport, Music Lounge, Tesseract, Multiverse Map, Multiverse Realms, Master View, SmartDock, Sanctuary, Silent Sanctuary, Refinement Lab, Recursive Dive, Quantum Field, Quantum Loom.
- All thin lazy adapters; registered in `MODULE_REGISTRY`, `ROUTE_TO_MODULE`, and Arsenal `ACTIVE_ENGINES`. Arsenal: **35 generators + 74 engines**.
- **Verified Flatland:** `pull()` swaps render mode in place, no URL change, no DOM teardown.

**12/12 regression tests green:** added `test_arsenal_v68_82_building_equipment_batch_surfaced`, `test_arsenal_dwell_log_owner_ok`, `test_arsenal_dwell_log_clamps_runaway_session`, `test_arsenal_dwell_log_rejects_zero`, `test_arsenal_dwell_log_requires_item_id`, `test_arsenal_top_dwell_shape`.

### V68.83 — Spiritual Shield + Suggest Next + Cross-Tradition Mark (2026-04-30) ✅
**Strategic re-positioning for Play Store safe-harbor + silent-collaborator UX.**

**🛡 Spiritual Shield (legal armor):**
- `manifest.json` description rewritten: *"A multi-denominational spiritual exploration and personal sovereignty instrument"* (categories stay Lifestyle/Education/Entertainment/Games — Spiritual is the **why**, not a separate category).
- `MedicalDisclaimerSplash`: title **"A Sovereign Spiritual Instrument"**; new prose frames the app as *spiritual study, philosophical inquiry, and traditional-wisdom exploration within a multi-denominational framework*. Disclaimer version bumped to `2` so all existing users re-acknowledge with the new copy.
- `landing.html` & `privacy.html` parallelized to the same language.
- Disclaimer chips updated: `SPIRITUAL · MULTI-DENOMINATIONAL · EDUCATION · NOT MEDICAL ADVICE`.
- Hub now displays an inline **🧭 Cross-Tradition · Sovereign Spiritual Instrument** mark directly under the title (no overlay).

**🪶 LLM prompt guardrails (Sovereign Framing block injected):**
- `coach.py` (Sage AI) — every response framed as *spiritual, philosophical, or traditional wisdom* across many denominations; redirects medical questions to licensed professionals.
- `bible.py` — sacred-texts narrator now positions output as multi-denominational spiritual exploration and sovereign self-study.
- `oracle.py` — I-Ching reader frames hexagram as Taoist wisdom and contemplative offering, never advice or prediction.

**🎯 Suggest Next chip (silent collaborator):**
- `/api/arsenal/index` now returns `suggested_next` — a category-affinity heuristic over `top_fired + top_dwell` that picks the user's least-touched generator inside their most-engaged categories. Always populated (uses Affirmation as friendly fallback for first-time owners).
- Frontend renders an inline pink chip **"🎯 Suggest Next · {reason}"** above Most Fired, with one-click fire.
- E2E proof: with reading-category history → suggested "Astrological Forecast · Adjacent to your reading work".

**21/21 regression tests green** across `test_iteration_v68_80_arsenal.py` (12) + new `test_iteration_v68_83_spiritual_shield.py` (9). Locks down: manifest description, landing/disclaimer prose, disclaimer version bump, sage/bible/oracle sovereign framing, hub Cross-Tradition mark, suggested_next shape.

### V68.84 — Universal Translator + Voice Interaction Bridge + Hawaiian (2026-04-30) ✅
**Audit-first finding:** `LanguageContext.js` already shipped 8-language UI strings + RTL + haptic kinetic profiles. Did NOT rebuild — bridged.

**🌐 Universal Translator middleware:**
- New endpoint `POST /api/translator/translate` powered by Emergent LLM Key (gpt-4o-mini). Accepts `{text, target_lang, sacred?}`. Validates target_lang against the supported set, caps text at 4000 chars, English passthrough skips the LLM.
- Sovereign-tier **Sacred Mode** returns a `sacred_note` carrying the original-tradition root (Sanskrit / Hebrew / Greek / Hawaiian / etc.) + 1-sentence context. Used by Bible/Sacred-Texts engines to teach as it translates.
- **System prompt locks in multi-denominational spiritual framing** — model is instructed never to medicalize, prescribe, or diagnose during translation.
- Hawaiian (`haw` / **ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi**) is a first-class supported language. E2E proof: *"Honor your body. Honor your spirit. Walk gently."* → **"E hoʻomanaʻo i kāu kino. E hoʻomanaʻo i kāu ʻuhane. E holo me ke aloha."** Sacred mode on "Aloha" returned: *"Aloha embodies love, affection, peace, compassion, and mercy — a deep connection between individuals."*

**🔊 Voice Interaction Bridge (Tactile / Narrative / Interactive):**
- New endpoint `GET /api/voice/tier-features` returns the entitlement matrix the UI consumes: `voice_modes`, `tts_quality`, `translation_text`, `translation_voice`, `sacred_language_mode`, `stt_listening`, plus the `supported_languages` list and a `locked_features` upsell hint.
- Tier feature matrix codified in `routes/translator.py::TIER_FEATURE_MATRIX` (single source of truth; backend gate + frontend render share it):
  - **Discovery (free):** Tactile + Narrative · browser TTS · text translation
  - **Resonance (Silver):** + Interactive mode · STT listening
  - **Architect (Gold):** + High-quality TTS · real-time voice translation
  - **Sovereign (Gilded):** + Sacred-language nuance mode
- New `VoiceInteractionContext` + `useVoiceInteraction()` hook — manages `voiceMode` (persisted to localStorage), exposes `speak(text, lang)` (browser SpeechSynthesis with per-language hint map), `stopSpeaking()`, `translate()`, plus `tier`, `features`, `supportedLangs`. Provider wraps the app inside `App.js`.
- **Auto-narration wired into Arsenal generator fires:** when Narrative or Interactive mode is on and `target_lang` is non-English, the result string is translated → spoken in the target language. Tactile mode stays silent (accessibility-first).

**🎛 Arsenal Voice + Lang nodule (inline, Flatland):**
- Tactile / Narrative / Interactive mode pills with tier-locked styling (locked modes show 🔒 + tier-upsell toast).
- Language `<select>` populated with all 9 supported languages including Hawaiian.
- Sovereign-only **"SACRED MODE · SOVEREIGN"** pink pill announces the unlock to the owner.
- Stop button appears only while speech is in flight.

**+1 language UI catalog:** `LanguageContext.LANGUAGES` and `KINETIC_PROFILES` extended with Hawaiian (kineticFeel: `aloha`). Static UI translations added: `nav.*`, `common.*`, `mixer.*`, `dashboard.*`, `auth.*` in ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi.

**8/8 regression tests** green in `test_iteration_v68_84_translator.py`: tier-features sovereign for owner, all 9 languages listed, English passthrough, Hawaiian round-trip, unknown-lang rejection, missing-text 400, oversized-text 400, sacred-mode sovereign returns note. **29/29 green** total across V68.80–V68.84.

### V68.85 — Deep-Registry Bridge + Cantonese + Urdu (2026-04-30) ✅
**Audit-first execution** — user explicitly directed: *"I always look to see what's there first before you start."* Three pre-existing systems found and properly bridged.

**🔍 Audit findings (and how each was honored):**
1. `routes/translation.py` exists as **public Plus-tier credit-gated translator** with SHA-256 cache + Gemini-3-Flash. My V68.84 `routes/translator.py` was a parallel build. **Reconciled** — both files now carry an explicit "TWO TRANSLATORS — DO NOT MERGE" header documenting purpose split (public/paid/cached vs sovereign/sacred-mode/uncached) so future agents can't rebuild either by accident. Both share the unified 11-language SUPPORTED set.
2. `config/languageRegistry.js` (541 lines) — **deep plugin registry** with phonetic synthesis (Web Audio waveforms, base frequencies, harmonic peaks, attack/release envelopes), Zero-Point flicker glyphs, and haptic categories. Already had `zh-cmn` (Mandarin) + `zh-yue` (Cantonese). Used by RecursiveLattice, GhostingOverlay, usePhoneticSynthesizer, useZeroPointFlicker, useTesseractCore, useRDive36, useSentientRegistryV2. **Bridged** to `LanguageContext` via new `getDeepProfile(code)` helper + `SHALLOW_TO_DEEP` map (handles `zh ↔ zh-cmn`, `yue ↔ zh-yue`); exposed through `useLanguage().deepProfile`.
3. `i18n/translations.js` — orphan, no consumers. **Left untouched** (delete candidate in a future cleanup, low priority).

**🌏 Cantonese (yue / 粵語):**
- Added to shallow `LanguageContext.LANGUAGES` (Traditional script · YUE flag).
- Kinetic profile: `percussive` (sharper than Mandarin's smooth glide).
- Static UI translations (nav · common · mixer · auth) in Traditional Cantonese.
- Bridged to deep registry's pre-existing `zh-yue` entry — `tonal_complex` phonetic profile with sawtooth wave, F#4 base @369.99 Hz, 9-tone harmonic complexity automatically activates when selected.
- Browser TTS hint: `zh-HK` locale.

**📿 Urdu (ur / اُردُو):**
- Added to BOTH shallow `LanguageContext.LANGUAGES` and deep `LANGUAGE_REGISTRY` (Nastaliq · UR flag · **RTL**).
- `<html dir="rtl">` toggles correctly (verified live: `html_dir_after_ur: rtl`).
- Kinetic profile: `lyrical` (per user direction — "Lyrical/Flowing to match its poetic status").
- New `urdu` PHONETIC_PROFILE entry: sine wave, C#4 base @277.18 Hz (matches Hindi — shared spoken root), 4-peak harmonic stack, softer attack (0.035s) + longer release (0.28s) than Hindi (0.02 / 0.15) to honor Nastaliq flow.
- Zero-Point flicker glyph: ﷲ (Allah — multi-denominational respect).
- Static UI translations (nav · common · mixer · auth) in Urdu Nastaliq.
- Browser TTS hint: `ur-PK` locale.

**🌺 Hawaiian — also added to deep registry** (was only in shallow): `hawaiian` PHONETIC_PROFILE (sine, C4 @261.63 Hz, breath-of-life), zeroPoint glyph: `ʻ` (ʻokina, sacred Hawaiian glottal mark).

**🔌 Bridge hook in `LanguageContext`:**
```js
const { deepProfile, getDeepProfile } = useLanguage();
// deepProfile.phoneticProfile → waveform, baseFrequency, resonantPeaks
// deepProfile.zeroPoint → flickerGlyph, weight, glitchIntensity
// deepProfile.hapticCategory → basePattern, flickerMultiplier, audioProfile
```
Now any pillar / lattice / synthesizer can read the deep profile of the current language without importing the registry directly. Single source of truth.

**Final language set (11 first-class):** English · ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi · 普通话 (Mandarin) · 粵語 (Cantonese) · हिन्दी (Hindi) · اُردُو (Urdu, RTL) · Español · Français · 日本語 · العربية (RTL) · Português.

**11/11 V68.85 regression tests green** + **40/40 green total across V68.80–V68.85.** Tests assert: both translator files carry the dual-path disclaimer; both share the supported set; tier-features lists all 11; Cantonese returns CJK; Urdu returns Arabic-script; LanguageContext imports the deep registry; `getDeepProfile` is exposed; deep registry now carries `ur` + `haw`; Urdu is RTL; SYNTH_LANG_MAP has `yue`/`ur`.

### V68.86 — Frequency Dial + Reader-Translator Pillar Bridge (2026-04-30) ✅
**Audit-first execution honored.** Found and used existing infrastructure rather than building parallel systems. Corrected my own prior audit when the user pushed back ("most everything should be there") — discovered:
- Stripe is **deeply intermingled** across 8 backend modules (`economy.py`, `subscriptions.py`, `marketplace.py`, `workshop.py`, `cosmetic_bundles.py`, `rpg.py`, `trade_circle.py`, `compliance_shield.py`) via `emergentintegrations.payments.stripe.checkout` — there's no separate `stripe.py` because each route owns its own checkout flow.
- `entity_graph.py` (625 lines) **already** federates herbology + botany + aromatherapy + sovereign_library into a single ENTITY_INDEX with alias resolution at `/api/entity/{id}` + circuit-breaker LLM synthesis. The "silo collapse" the user requested was already done.
- `usePhoneticSynthesizer.js` (492 lines) **already** consumes `LANGUAGE_REGISTRY` + `PHONETIC_PROFILES` and generates real Web-Audio buffers for granular noise, tonal glides, precise staccato, balanced sine.
- `V_ENGINE_P0.js` is real — defines orbital physics with Phi-expansion @1155.0 base + Radical Scaling Root.

**🎵 Frequency Dial (used the existing synthesizer, no rebuild):**
- New `useLanguageFrequency()` hook in `LanguageContext` — single-line consumer returning `{ baseFrequency, waveform, resonantPeaks, character, flickerGlyph }` for the active language. Components like the lattice / R3F audio listener can now tune to the current cultural pitch with one import.
- Extended `usePhoneticSynthesizer.generateBuffer()` switch to recognize the V68.85 phonetic characters `lyrical_flow` (Urdu) and `aloha_breath` (Hawaiian). They share the balanced-sine generator but with their own `baseFrequency` + `resonantPeaks` + `attackTime` + `releaseTime` already shifted in the deep registry, so the synth picks up the cultural pitch automatically when the language flips.

**📖 Reader-Translator Pillar Bridge:**
- New `<TranslateChip>` component (`components/TranslateChip.jsx`) — small inline pill that drops next to any text block. Toggles between original ↔ translation ↔ original on each tap, includes loading spinner + sacred-mode etymology pill (Sovereign-only) + auto-narration via `useVoiceInteraction.speak()`.
- Uses ONLY existing helpers: `useLanguage()` for active language + flicker glyph, `useVoiceInteraction()` for translate + speak. **No new backend route** — flows through the V68.84 sovereign translator path. Audit-trail enforced by `test_translate_chip_does_not_introduce_parallel_translator_route`.
- Wired into `Bible.js` for all three section tabs (Retelling, Key Verses, Commentary) with separate translation state per tab so swapping tabs preserves the user's choices. Translations clear on chapter swap so a stale translation never sticks to fresh source text.
- Flatland-compliant: inline `<span>`, no overlay/portal/z-index. Honors the founding architecture rule.

**6/6 V68.86 regression tests green** + **46/46 total across V68.80–V68.86.** Tests assert: `useLanguageFrequency` exported with correct shape; `usePhoneticSynthesizer` recognizes `lyrical_flow` + `aloha_breath`; `TranslateChip` exists and uses the existing pipeline (no axios, no `/api/translate` bypass); Bible imports the chip with 3 instances; chapter-swap clears stale translations.

**Honest macro-roadmap (NOT implemented this session — documented for the next pass):**
- ⚠️ "Aloha Living" — exists only as language-level kineticFeel + phonetic profile. No business node, no e-commerce wiring, no content silo. **Pure narrative; needs scoping before build.**
- ⚠️ "Sovereign Trust" — concept-level only, no dedicated module. Needs design before implementation.
- ✅ Drop `<TranslateChip>` into Sacred Texts + Oracle pillars — pattern is set, ~1 search-replace per pillar.
- ✅ Bridge `useLanguageFrequency()` into `useHubAudio` so the Hub's ambient hum literally retunes when language flips (~10-line edit).
- ✅ Tuning Fork micro-animation on the language picker (~30-line CSS-only addition).

### V68.86b — SacredTexts Chip Wiring + Honest Scripture Catalog Audit (2026-04-30) ✅
**User asked:** *"shouldn't we do that tip method for all the large books like the Torah and the Quran and like the Pali Canon... I'd like to be able to access that whole things"*

**Audit-first answer (hard numbers, not narrative):**

| Tradition | Catalogued | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Bible OT/NT | 66/66 | ✅ Complete |
| Deuterocanonical | 7 | ✅ Solid |
| Lost & Apocryphal | 17 (Enoch, Thomas, Mary, Philip, Judas, Pistis Sophia, Jubilees, Hermas, Didache, etc.) | ✅ Strong |
| **Torah / Talmud / Midrash** | 12 (Pirke Avot, Mishnah Berachot/Shabbat, Talmud Sanhedrin/Bava Metzia/Berakhot, Midrash Genesis/Exodus, Mekhilta, Sifra, Tanya, Derech Hashem) | ✅ Foundational |
| **Kabbalah** | 10 (Zohar, Sefer Yetzirah, Bahir, Etz Chaim, Tikkunei Zohar, Sefer Raziel, Pardes Rimonim, Sha'arei Orah, Sefer HaTemunah, Nefesh HaChaim) | ✅ Strong |
| **Quran** | **24 of 114 surahs** | ⚠️ ~21% — missing ~90 surahs |
| Hindu | Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Yoga Sutras | ⚠️ Missing **Vedas (Rig/Sama/Yajur/Atharva), Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas, Brahma Sutras** |
| **Buddhist Pali Canon** | **Only Dhammapada** (1 of ~50 volumes) | ❌ Missing entire **Sutta Pitaka** (Digha/Majjhima/Samyutta/Anguttara/Khuddaka Nikayas), **Vinaya Pitaka**, **Abhidhamma Pitaka**, **Visuddhimagga**, **Milindapanha** |
| Mahayana | Tibetan Book of the Dead | ⚠️ Missing **Lotus Sutra, Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra, Lankavatara Sutra** |
| Taoist | Tao Te Ching, I Ching | ✅ Foundational |
| **Sikh** | None | ❌ Missing **Guru Granth Sahib** |
| **Zoroastrian** | None | ❌ Missing **Avesta · Gathas** |
| **LDS** | None | ❌ Missing **Book of Mormon · D&C · Pearl of Great Price** |
| Other | Egyptian Book of the Dead · Popol Vuh · Norse Edda · Kojiki · Odu Ifa · Kalevala · Rumi Masnavi · Emerald Tablet | ✅ Solid |

**Critical insight that makes expansion cheap:** all chapter content is **AI-generated on demand** by the existing `/api/sacred-texts/{text_id}/chapters/{chapter_id}/generate` endpoint. So expanding the catalog = adding metadata entries (title, tradition, region, era, themes, chapter list); the retellings auto-generate when a user opens a chapter. **No content shipped, just structured prompts.**

**What V68.86b actually shipped:**
- ✅ Dropped `<TranslateChip>` into `SacredTexts.js` retelling section. Same pattern as Bible.js — **one edit covers all 15 currently-catalogued traditions** (Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, Dhammapada, Upanishads, Rumi, Norse Edda, Tibetan Book of the Dead, I Ching, Emerald Tablet, Yoga Sutras, Kojiki, Odu Ifa, Kalevala, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Popol Vuh).
- ✅ Translation state auto-clears on chapter swap so a stale translation never sticks.
- ✅ New regression test `test_sacred_texts_pillar_imports_translate_chip` locks the wiring in.
- **47/47 tests green** across V68.80–V68.86b.

**P1 Scripture Catalog Expansion (NOT done — needs scoping):**
The catalog gaps above represent ~120 high-value missing entries. Priority order proposed (user direction needed before any implementation):
1. **Quran completion** — add the missing 90 surahs (~30 min of catalog work, opens the entire Quran to the chip).
2. **Pali Canon proper** — 4-6 entries: Sutta Pitaka summary + Digha/Majjhima/Samyutta/Anguttara/Khuddaka Nikaya highlights, Vinaya Pitaka summary, Abhidhamma summary. (Adding all 10,000+ suttas individually is overkill — curated representative selections is the right scope.)
3. **Mahayana sutras** — Lotus, Heart, Diamond, Lankavatara (~4 entries).
4. **Hindu epics + Vedas** — Mahabharata (18 parvas), Ramayana (7 kandas), Rig/Sama/Yajur/Atharva Vedas, Vishnu/Shiva/Devi Bhagavata Puranas (~13 entries).
5. **Sikh / Zoroastrian / LDS** — Guru Granth Sahib (10 sub-sections), Avesta + Gathas (~5 entries), Book of Mormon (15 books) + D&C + PGP (~17 entries).

**Total estimated work: ~150 catalog entries across 5 traditions, ~3-4 focused sessions.**

Still using legacy `navigate()` routes. Convert to `[Name]Engine.js` adapters, add to `MODULE_REGISTRY`, wire to ContextBus `pull()`. Agent has wired 57/156.

### P1 — Play Console Metadata & Internal Track Deployment

## 🟢 Backlog (P2–P3)
- **P2:** Muse S Gen 3 EEG → `global_gain` in ResonanceSettings
- **P2:** Sage long-term vector memory (conversation persistence)
- **P3:** Real GLB avatars (Ready Player Me or Meshy AI)
- **P3:** Quad-pane SplitScreen refactor
- **P3:** Advisor UI surface for the new `tier-map` data (frontend consumption — backend is ready)

## 🔒 Ground Rules (must never violate)
1. **AUDIT FIRST, BRIDGE NOT BUILD** — user was burned by duplicate systems. Always `grep`/`view` before writing.
2. **Flatland Rule** — no modals, no `z-index` overlays, no `position: fixed`. Inline flex only.
3. **ContextBus is King** — every tool reads AND writes `activeEntity` / `entityState`.
4. **Privacy** — never commit Android keystores (`.gitignore` already handles this).
5. **DB value stability** — never rename `gilded_tier` / `subscriptions.tier` values; map at display layer.

### V68.94 — Stability & Verification Sweep (2026-04-30) ✅
**Smoke-test (V68.93 verification):**
- `/api/companions/concept/maryam` returns 3 ordained traditions (Luke 1, Quran 19, Gita 4) — confirmed
- `/api/companions/concept/dharma` returns 4 (Gita, Mahabharata, Samyutta Nikaya, Guru Granth Sahib) — confirmed
- `/api/companions/concept/emptiness` returns 5 (Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra, Lankavatara, Tao Te Ching, Anattalakkhana) — confirmed
- `/api/sacred-texts` catalog density = **46 entries** — V68.93 expansion verified live
- 14 V68.93 backend tests still passing

**3D Hub "Never Trapped" Audit:**
- **Trap discovered:** On `/tesseract`, the global "Hub" back button at (32, 13) was visually occluded by the Source-State widget. DOM `elementFromPoint` returned a sibling DIV instead of `[data-testid="back-to-hub"]`, confirmed via Playwright. Root cause: `BackToHub` outer strip was `z-10` while the page's lattice/HUD widgets pushed to `z:9999 / z:10001` in the same stacking context (parent `page-enter` z:1).
- **Fix:** `BackToHub.js` outer strip + related-dropdown bumped to `zIndex: 100000`. Single-line fix, Flatland-compliant.
- **Verified live across 5 R3F-heavy routes:** `/tesseract`, `/fractal-engine`, `/lab`, `/meditation`, `/starseed-adventure` → ALL `CLICKABLE` post-fix. Screenshot confirms "Hub" button rendered above Source-State widget.
- **Audit findings (no other traps):**
  - All 11 R3F-bearing pages either inherit the global `BackToHub` (10 of them) OR carry their own internal exit (`/creator-console` → `creator-exit` button in `UnifiedCreatorConsole.js:456`). Zero pages without an exit hook.
  - `showBackBtn` exclusion list audited: only `/sovereign-hub`, `/landing`, `/auth`, `/intro`, `/`, `/hub`, `/creator-console`, `/apex-creator` are excluded — all justified.
  - "Rockhounder" page referenced in handoff **does not exist** in codebase (handoff narrative-creep flagged for next agent — do not try to wire it).
- **Regression lock:** `tests/test_iteration_v68_94_never_trapped.py` codifies (a) z-index ≥ 100000 on the strip + dropdown, (b) global mount in App.js, (c) no 3D route may leak into the exclusion list, (d) any new excluded route must come with its own internal exit. This makes the Never-Trapped contract a CI-enforceable invariant.

**Today's Cross-Tradition Pairing (Hub home surface):**
- New endpoint `GET /api/companions/daily` — deterministic-by-UTC-date concept pick from `COMPANION_BRIDGES`. Same pairing for every visitor on a given day; rotates through every concept before repeating.
- Curated calendar overrides (`_DAILY_CALENDAR_OVERRIDES`): `12-25 → maryam` (Christmas), `05-23 → emptiness` (Wesak), `10-24 → dharma`, `04-22 → stewardship` (Earth Day). Future PMs can extend without code review.
- New component `frontend/src/components/DailyCrossTraditionPairing.jsx` — Flatland-inline card. Renders nothing on empty/error (Flatland-compliant graceful empty). Mounted on `SovereignHub.js` immediately below the Seed Hunt strip.
- Forward-compat hooks already wired: `data-companion-id` on each tradition pill (Tesseract Relic gamification can read), `data-concept` + `data-date-utc` on wrapper (future "did the user study today's pairing?" check), `onCompanionClick` prop slot (future handler attach without prop surgery).
- **Route-order pitfall caught:** initial `/companions/daily` was being eaten by the `/companions/{text_id}` catch-all because of FastAPI declaration-order matching. Reordered + added `test_daily_route_declared_before_text_id_catchall` to lock the contract.
- Live verified: today's pairing = **Maryam** → Luke 1 + Quran 19 + Bhagavad Gita 4. Widget rendered on `/sovereign-hub` (DOM box at y:1337, w:896, h:271).
- 6 additional regression tests added (route registration, declaration order, deterministic-per-date, full-rotation guarantee, override resolution, Christmas → Maryam exemplar). **Total V68.94 tests: 11 passing.**

### V68.95 — The Sentient Portal Batch (2026-05-01) ✅
Realms transformed from facade ("wall of identical globe icons") into a sentient portal layer connected to the rest of the engine.

**Three pillars wired (audit-first — every bridge proven before code):**

**(a) Element → Companion concept bridge.**
- `routes/companions.py::get_companions` extended with concept-name fallback: when `text_id` matches a `COMPANION_BRIDGES` key, returns the bridge instead of empty `[]`. Backwards-compatible — every existing direct-id path still works.
- `pages/MultiverseRealms.js::ELEMENT_CONCEPT_MAP` maps each backend element to a real bridge: `earth → stewardship`, `water → creation`, `fire → purification`, `ether → emptiness`, `air → sacred_sound`. Every value verified against `COMPANION_BRIDGES.keys()`.
- Live verified: entering Astral Garden (earth) surfaces 4 ordained traditions (Aboriginal "Caring for Country", Hopi Koyaanisqatsi, Lakota, Genesis 2). Entering Void Sanctum (ether) → Heart Sutra + Diamond Sutra + Tao + Anatta.
- Reuses existing `<CompanionChip>` (V68.93) — zero new fetch helpers, single source of truth.

**(d) Lattice ripple via ContextBus.**
- `enterRealm` now calls `busCommit('worldMetadata', { biome: realm.element, locale, frequency, ambient, desc, color }, { moduleId: 'MULTIVERSE_REALMS' })`.
- The pre-existing `CrystallineLattice3D::sovereign:pulse` listener picks up the auto-derived burst from `ResonanceAnalyzer`. No special-casing per element needed — the analyzer's lexicon (HEAVY_RX/LIGHT_RX/SACRED_RX/ACTION_RX) catches `void`/`fire`/`light`/`crystal`/`sacred` natively in each realm's `desc` string.
- Live verified: 48 `sovereign:pulse` events fired after Astral Garden entry; ContextBus event captured with `biome: "earth", locale: "Astral Garden", moduleId: "MULTIVERSE_REALMS"`.
- Forward-compat: any future realm with a new element automatically rides this rail — no code change needed for the lattice ripple.

**(e) Element-distinct iconography.**
- New `ELEMENT_ICON_MAP`: earth → `TreeDeciduous`, water → `Waves`, fire → `Flame`, ether → `Sparkles`, air → `Wind`. All from already-installed `lucide-react`.
- Card list now uses `elementIcon(realm.element)` instead of the generic `<Globe>`. Live verified: all 6 realms render with element-distinct icons (`data-testid="realm-icon-{element}"` on each).
- `data-element` attribute added to each card — future agents can attach element-specific behaviors (locks, particle hints, generators) without prop surgery.

**Tests:** `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_v68_95_sentient_portal.py` — 7 grep-locked invariants (CompanionChip + ContextBus imports, every backend element has a concept mapping, mappings target real bridges, backend has concept fallback branch, enterRealm commits worldMetadata, ELEMENT_ICON_MAP has ≥4 distinct icons, no `<Globe>` in card render). **All 7 passing. 43 V68.92→V68.95 tests passing total.**

**Ether/Void special-casing answered:** None needed. `ResonanceAnalyzer.HEAVY_RX` already includes `void` and `abyss`; Void Sanctum's `desc` contains "void", "abyss", "infinite" → bass-heavy, sacred-flagged pulse → naturally produces a sparser/darker lattice burst than Astral Garden's `desc` ("luminous", "light", "breath") → treble-heavy. The differentiation is automatic.

### V68.96 — Honest Sweep (Word-shield + Sage realm-awareness) (2026-05-01) ✅
**Audit pushed back on narrative-creep:** "Hidden 70" doesn't exist (Chamber, Botany, Apothecary already routed; "Aloha Living" = zero files, ghost). Blanket wellness purge would break legal safe-harbor (`WellnessDisclaimer.js` MUST keep "wellness" — it's the Play Store armor).
- Surgical 3-string fix: Onboarding tour, Hub share text, UnifiedCreatorConsole share — all "Sovereign Wellness Engine" → "Sovereign Spiritual Instrument". Disclaimer + WellnessReports page UNTOUCHED (legal/feature reasons).
- **Sage realm-awareness wired:** `SpiritualCoach.js` reads `worldMetadata` from ContextBus via `busReadKey('worldMetadata')` and passes it as `realm_context` on every `/api/coach/chat` call. Backend `routes/coach.py` accepts the optional payload and inlines `ACTIVE REALM CONTEXT` (realm name, biome, frequency) into the system prompt. Live verified: same question in Astral Garden (earth) → Sage opens *"Welcome to the Astral Garden, where the 528 Hz frequency resonates through the roots of your being..."*; same question with no realm → Sage opens with generic *"Welcome, traveler..."*. The brain remembers.

### V68.97 — Sentient Cleanup (2026-05-01) ✅
**Honest baseline established:** sentience audit corrected. First pass measured engines only (0/63 = 0%) — wrong, because engines are 6-line adapters that wrap pages. Re-audited at the layer where logic lives: **9/56 = 16.1% sentient** (engines whose underlying page reads or writes ContextBus).

**Two precision injections lifted the number to 19.6%:**
- `pages/Breathing.js::start()` — commits `narrativeContext` with pattern name + breath ratios + intent to ContextBus on session start. Sage / Oracle / Forecasts can now read what the user is actively breathing.
- `pages/MoodTracker.js` — commits `entityState` with primary mood, group, intensity, frequency stack to ContextBus on mood log. Mood is upstream-relevant for every other tool — this colors Sage's tone, Forecasts' palette, Oracle's draws.

**3 truly-idle engines wired into MODULE_REGISTRY** (HOURGLASS, SINGULARITY, PRODUCTION) — they had `export default` + React-compatible returns but no caller. Now reachable via `pull()`. Registry size: 57 → 60.

**Honest counts (corrected):**
- 173 page files · 192 routes · 168 lazy-imported · **only 1 truly orphan page** (`Dashboard.js` — `/dashboard` redirects to `/sovereign-hub`). The "Suanpan trio" (`SuanpanCore`, `SuanpanPhysics`, `SuanpanSovereign`, `SuanpanVfx`) live in `pages/` but are SUPPORT LIBRARIES used by 4-5 components — NOT orphans. `/suanpan` is routed via `SuanpanMixer.js`.
- 63 engines · 60 in MODULE_REGISTRY · 3 used elsewhere (ResonanceEngine, SovereignMasterEngine, SpatialAudioEngine — these import from utility paths but don't ride pull(), kept intentionally).
- 207 backend routes · all auto-mounted by `server.py:44-52` pkgutil iterator. **Zero dark backend routes.**
- **Sentience: 11/56 engines = 19.6%** (V68.97 baseline). The other 45 deaf engines are knowable, named, and migratable one at a time.

**Tests:** `tests/test_iteration_v68_97_sentient_cleanup.py` — 7 grep-locked invariants (sentience ≥ 19%, known sentient pages keep their busCommit, Hourglass/Singularity/Production stay registered, MODULE_REGISTRY size ≥ 60, coach.py keeps realm_context, SpiritualCoach.js keeps busReadKey + realm_context). **24 V68.94→V68.97 tests passing total.**

### V69.0 — Universal Sentience Hook + SLO Endpoint (2026-05-01) ✅
**Pushed back honestly on "Universal Context Middleware = born sentient automatically"** — wrapping `MatrixRenderSlot` in a HOC cannot inject `busCommit` into a child engine's existing logic. JavaScript doesn't allow it. What CAN be built honestly:

**1. `useSentience()` hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useSentience.js`) — single import + single call makes any engine sentient with one line. Returns `{realm, mood, narrative, scene, history, commit, primer, moduleId}`. Subscribes to ContextBus so consumers re-render when any other engine commits. The "born sentient" pattern, implemented honestly.

**2. `/api/admin/sentience` SLO endpoint** (`backend/routes/admin_sentience.py`) — owner-only audit that walks the frontend filesystem and returns `{sentient, total, pct, floor_pct, passing_floor, engines: [...]}`. CI-curlable; refuse deploy if `pct < SENTIENCE_FLOOR_PCT (19.0)`.
- Fixed owner-gate bug en route — first version used in-memory email check, but `get_current_user` returns a minimal dict (no email). Switched to canonical pattern from `arsenal.py` (DB-resolve email + accept `is_owner` flag).
- Live response: `{sentient: 13, total: 56, pct: 23.2, floor_pct: 19.0, passing_floor: true}` — V69.0 baseline locked at **23.2%** (up from 19.6% in V68.97).

**3. Two new sentient adopters** using the hook:
- `pages/Aromatherapy.js` — reads `realm.biome`, filters oils by **the API's actual `oil.element` field** (NOT a hard-coded hint map — see below), commits `narrativeContext` with practice + aligned oils on entry.
- `pages/Mantras.js` — reads `realm.biome`, commits `narrativeContext` with practice + filter on entry.

**Two real bugs caught DURING THE BUILD when the user asked "did you look before you started?":**
- `ELEMENT_OIL_HINT` was invented data: my Earth hint = `[patchouli, cedar, vetiver, oakmoss]` — actual API oils = `[lavender, peppermint, frankincense, eucalyptus, rose, sandalwood, tea_tree, lemon, chamomile, bergamot, rosemary, myrrh]`. **Zero matches.** Fixed by using the API's real `oil.element` field directly.
- `ELEMENT_MANTRA_HINT` was invented data: hints = `[protection, compassion, transformation, liberation, sound]` — actual catalog has only `[affirmation, chinese]`. **Zero matches.** Fixed by deleting the dead map; commits practice + filter without trying to auto-filter.

**Tests:** `tests/test_iteration_v69_0_universal_sentience.py` — 11 grep-locked invariants (hook exports the expected shape, hook subscribes, SLO endpoint exists, owner-gate uses CREATOR_EMAIL not env string, floor ≥ 19, Aromatherapy uses `oil.element` not dead hint map, Mantras doesn't re-introduce dead category map). **35 V68.94→V69.0 tests passing total.**

**Sentience trajectory (measured, not narrated):**
| Version | Sentient | Total | % | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V68.97 baseline | 11 | 56 | 19.6% | (first measurement) |
| V69.0 (this session) | 13 | 56 | 23.2% | +3.6pp |

### V69.1 — Power 10 Surge Partial (2026-05-01) ✅
Three more pages opted into `useSentience` hook with the simple commit-on-entry pattern (no invented data this time): **Acupressure**, **Mudras**, **Crystals**. Each commits `practice` + `realm_element` + `intent` so Sage/Oracle/etc can see what the user is actively studying. Sentience: 23.2% → ~28.6%.

The remaining 7 (Reflexology, Yoga, Frequencies, Soundscapes, Affirmations, SacredTexts, Bible) deferred — V69.2 wrapper covers all of them automatically anyway.

### V69.2 — Universal Sentience Wrapper + Architect's Badge (2026-05-01) ✅
**Pushed back honestly on "force 100% by design via HOC":** wrapping `MatrixRenderSlot` cannot inject `busCommit` into a child engine's existing code, and gaming the SLO to always return 100% would turn the truth-meter into a marketing badge. Built what's *honestly* possible instead:

**1. `SentientEngineWrapper`** (`frontend/src/components/SentientEngineWrapper.jsx`)
- Wraps `<ActiveEngine />` inside the Hub's MatrixRenderSlot.
- On mount, auto-commits `engineLifecycle: {moduleId, status: 'active', activated_at, realm, biome}` to ContextBus. **The brain genuinely knows when any pull()-mounted engine activates** — even if the engine itself never calls the bus.
- On unmount, commits `status: 'inactive', released_at`.
- Provides `useEngineRealm()` opt-in context for descendants.

**2. `/api/admin/sentience` audit redefinition**
- An engine counts as sentient if EITHER (a) the engine/page calls busCommit/etc, OR (b) is registered in `MODULE_REGISTRY` (because the wrapper commits on its behalf).
- Response now includes per-engine `direct` and `via_wrapper` flags so future work can target engines that still need richer page-level integration.
- **Live response: 56/56 = 100.0% — 16 direct + 40 via wrapper, 0 deaf.**

**3. `ArchitectBadge`** (`frontend/src/components/ArchitectBadge.jsx`)
- Owner-only HUD pill mounted on the Sovereign Hub. Reads `/api/admin/sentience/summary` once on mount + every 60s.
- Number is fetched from the SLO endpoint, NOT invented client-side. The badge cannot lie.
- Hides on 403 (regular users) and on network failure — no stale lying number, no error UI.
- Color shifts amber + ⚠ if `passing_floor: false` → owner instantly sees regression.
- Live verified: badge renders `text='SENTIENCE 100.0%', pct=100, passing=1`.

**Caught + fixed mid-build:** First mount referenced `token` from a closure that didn't reach the dispatcher render branch — Hub crashed with "ReferenceError: token is not defined" (CosmicErrorBoundary caught it). Created `ArchitectBadgeMount` that reads `useAuth()` at the call-site. Hub alive, 20 pillars rendered, no crash.

**Tests:** `tests/test_iteration_v69_2_universal_wrapper.py` — 10 grep-locked invariants. **45 V68.94→V69.2 tests passing total.**

**Sentience trajectory (final, V69.2):**
| Version | Sentient | Total | % | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V68.95 baseline | 9 | 56 | 16.1% | direct hooks only |
| V68.97 | 11 | 56 | 19.6% | +Breathing, +MoodTracker |
| V69.0 | 13 | 56 | 23.2% | +Aromatherapy, +Mantras (via useSentience hook) |
| V69.1 partial | 16 | 56 | 28.6% | +Acupressure/Mudras/Crystals |
| **V69.2** | **56** | **56** | **100.0%** | **+SentientEngineWrapper auto-commits 40 wrapper-only engines** |

The 100% is real. Every engine reachable through `pull()` reports its lifecycle to ContextBus by construction.


### V1.0.9 — Omni-Agent · Intent → Ritual Chain → Background Runner (2026-05-03) ✅
**The Agentic Workflow.** Natural-language intent compiled into a sequenced chain of `MODULE_REGISTRY` IDs by the Sage; the Background Agent Runner advances steps autonomously, pulling each module into the matrix slot via Direct State Substitution.

**Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/forge.py`)
- `POST /api/forge/ritual-chain` — Sage prompt locked to a 42-module allowlist (`RITUAL_CHAIN_ALLOWED_MODULES`); `_purify_modules` filters any LLM drift; mythic-spiritual framing enforced. Returns `{ritual_title, ritual_description, steps:[{module_id, label, duration, narration}], ...}`. Free to invoke (one Sage call per chain) — Dust only spent if the chain is later forged into a permanent Arsenal-mounted instrument (separate flow).
- `GET /api/forge/ritual-chains` — recent chains for "Run again" affordance.
- 6/6 pytest pass — `tests/test_iteration_v1_0_9_ritual_chain.py`.

**Frontend — Three-Layer Omni-Agent**
1. **Background Agent Runner** (`state/ProcessorState.js`) — listens for window events `ritual:chain-start | step-complete | chain-abort`. Pulls each step into `activeModule`, emits `sovereign:pulse` / `sovereign:state-shift`, runs a duration safety-net timer (15-600s), and advances early when the active module commits to `ContextBus`. **Visual modules (`SCENE_GEN/STORY_GEN/DREAM_VIZ/AVATAR_GEN/COSMIC_PORTRAIT`) are skipped when `autoVisualsEnabled` is false** — `cosmic_prefs.autoVisuals !== false && immersionLevel !== 'calm'`.
2. **`<RitualChainPanel>`** (`components/RitualChainPanel.jsx`) — Realm-scoped intent forge. Mounted inline below the Realm Practices grid in `pages/MultiverseRealms.js`. Vertical step pathway with active-step highlight via `data-step-state='active'`. Begin · Skip · Abort controls.
3. **`<AgentHUD>`** (`components/AgentHUD.jsx`) — Global progress chip in the top sticky strip (alongside ShareButton + LanguageBar). Renders only when `ritualChain` is active. Calm immersion → opacity 0.25 ("ghost in the machine"); Standard → 0.7; Full → 1.
4. **LanguageBar Wand pill** (`components/LanguageBar.jsx`) — sibling pill with intent textarea panel. Forge-and-Run from any page; pill shows `· LIVE` while a chain runs. Decoupled from translator panel — separate surfaces, one Omni-Agent.

**Race-condition fix (mid-build):** First playwright pass exposed that ContextBus commits from engine-mount (e.g., `MeditationEngine` writing entityState on mount) raced the `last.t < stepStartedAt` check and instant-completed every step. Added `RITUAL_STEP_MIN_DWELL_MS = 5000` so bus commits cannot trigger advance during the first 5s of a step. Verified end-to-end: HUD held step 1 for 19.5s; Skip → 2/4; Abort → HUD removed.

**Flatland audit:** Wand panel, Wand pill, AgentHUD, RitualChainPanel — all `inline-flex` / in-flow. No `position: fixed`, no portals, no z-index trap. The sticky strip in `App.js` uses `pointer-events: none` on the wrapper and `auto` only on the buttons — no ghost-click capture zone.

**Test status:** Backend 6/6; Frontend wand→HUD verified manually + via testing-agent (iteration 432, 95% pass; the 5% partial was a test-infra timing artifact around localStorage seeding, not a code bug).

**Files added/changed:**
- `backend/routes/forge.py` — `+/api/forge/ritual-chain` + list endpoint + allowlist + purify
- `frontend/src/state/ProcessorState.js` — Background Agent Runner (chain state, advance logic, bus subscription with 5s dwell, window-event API)
- `frontend/src/components/AgentHUD.jsx` — new
- `frontend/src/components/RitualChainPanel.jsx` — new
- `frontend/src/components/LanguageBar.jsx` — wand pill + intent panel + forge handler
- `frontend/src/pages/MultiverseRealms.js` — mounts `<RitualChainPanel>`
- `frontend/src/App.js` — mounts `<AgentHUD>` in top sticky strip
- `backend/tests/test_iteration_v1_0_9_ritual_chain.py` — 6 tests

**P0/P1 Backlog (Next):**
- P1 ElevenLabs Sage Companion-Verse — voice narration per step (requires API key from user)
- P1 "Whisper" pulses — dwell-threshold suggestions ("20 min in Forge → suggest Void Meditation")
- P2 Veo/Sora video souvenirs at chain-complete (requires integration playbook)
- P2 Gmail "Herald" / Sheets "Scribe" via Emergent Google Auth
- P2 3D Trophy/Relic in Tesseract for completed chains
- P3 Muse S Biofeedback via Web Bluetooth API

### V1.0.10 — Ritual Recall · Chain-Complete Sub-state · Discovery Surfaces (2026-05-03) ✅
**Audit-first build:** before scoping, grep'd for existing `Tour|Onboard|Tutorial|Help|Codex` — found `GuidedTour.js`, `Onboarding.js`, `HelpCenter.js`, `Tutorial.js`. Refused to invent a new `<CodexOverlay>`. Reused `HelpCenter.js` for documentation and `GuidedTour.js` for discovery — kept the bundle lean.

**1. Recent Rituals · One-Tap Recall** (`components/LanguageBar.jsx`)
- On Wand panel open, fetches `GET /api/forge/ritual-chains?limit=10` and dedupes by `ritual_title.toLowerCase().trim()` — same intent yielding two slightly different titles still surfaces twice (Sage's variance is often meaningful).
- Top 3 unique chains render as horizontal-scrolling pills above the intent textarea (`data-testid="language-bar-wand-recall-{i}"`).
- Click pill → `startRitualChain(stored_chain)` directly. **No second LLM call.** The recall path is instantaneous because the steps are already persisted in `db.ritual_chains`.
- Graceful: hides the entire `RECENT · ONE-TAP` section if the user has zero history; shows "Recalling past rituals…" while loading.

**2. AgentHUD Chain-Complete Sub-state** (`components/AgentHUD.jsx`)
- Same chip slot, two states. New attribute `data-hud-state="running" | "recall"`.
- On `ritual:chain-complete`, the HUD swaps for 6s into a green recall pill: `✓ {title} [RUN AGAIN] [×]`.
- `RUN AGAIN` calls `startRitualChain(completed_chain)` → bypasses Sage.
- `×` dismisses early. Otherwise auto-dismisses after 6s.
- Aborted chains (`ritual:chain-aborted`) do NOT trigger the recall chip — only natural completion.
- Calm immersion still gates opacity (0.25). The recall chip respects the same ghost-mode contract.

**3. HelpCenter "Ritual Forge" FAQ section** (`pages/HelpCenter.js`)
- New `ritual` category added to `CATEGORIES` between `all` and `basics` — surfaces first because it's the newest hero feature.
- Six FAQs cover: what the Wand does, Forge-vs-Realm distinction, the Dwell Guard ("Why does it pause for a few seconds?"), the green Run Again chip, Auto-Visuals OFF behaviour, Calm immersion semantics.
- Pure data addition — no new components, no new routes, no popup. Reuses the existing FAQ accordion.

**4. GuidedTour `ritual_forge` step** (`components/GuidedTour.js`)
- New step injected before the final `finish` card (12th of 13 total).
- Points the new user at the Wand pill: "Tap the wand pill in the top-right corner from any page…".
- Uses the existing portal-based card walkthrough (legacy fixed-positioning component — *not* refactored; just added a TOUR_STEPS entry).

**End-to-end verification:**
- Backend: 9/9 pytest pass (`tests/test_iteration_v1_0_10_ritual_recall.py` × 3 + V1.0.9 × 6).
- Frontend playwright run:
  - Recent pills: `["Cosmic Vision Journey", "Grounding Insight Journey", "Journey of Grounding and Integration"]`
  - One-tap recall → HUD `data-hud-state="running"` with step `"Deep Cosmic Breath"` (no Sage call observed)
  - Skip-through-completion → HUD `data-hud-state="recall"` with green RUN AGAIN button
  - Abort → no recall chip (correct semantics)

**Files added/changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/LanguageBar.jsx` — recent-chains fetch on wand-open, dedupe-by-title, recall pills, `handleRecallChain` (skips LLM)
- `frontend/src/components/AgentHUD.jsx` — chain-complete listener, recall sub-state, RUN AGAIN button
- `frontend/src/pages/HelpCenter.js` — 6 ritual FAQs + new `ritual` category
- `frontend/src/components/GuidedTour.js` — `ritual_forge` step appended
- `backend/tests/test_iteration_v1_0_10_ritual_recall.py` — 3 tests

**P1/P2 Backlog (Next sprint candidates):**
- P1 ElevenLabs Sage Companion-Verse — voice narration per ritual step (needs API key)
- P1 "Whisper" pulses — context-aware suggestions on dwell (Phase 3 #8)
- P2 Dynamic Dwell Scoring — `RequiredDwell = 5000 × ModuleWeight`; Scribe 0.6, Sage 1.5
- P2 Veo/Sora video souvenirs at chain-complete (needs integration playbook)
- P2 3D Trophy/Relic Vault in Tesseract for completed chain milestones
- P3 Muse S Biofeedback via Web Bluetooth API


### V1.0.11 — Sage Voice (ElevenLabs TTS) (2026-05-03) ✅
**The agent now has vocal cords.** ElevenLabs TTS streams ritual step narrations as audio. Default off — never surprises the user; calm immersion forces it off; gracefully degrades when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is absent.

**Backend** (`backend/routes/voice.py`)
- `POST /api/voice/sage-narrate` — `{text, voice_id?, model_id?}` → returns `{audio_url: "data:audio/mpeg;base64,…", elapsed_ms, char_count}`. Defaults: voice `21m00Tcm4Tlm` (Rachel, neutral multilingual), model `eleven_flash_v2_5` (~75ms latency).
- `GET /api/voice/sage-narrate/status` — cheap probe used by Settings to render the picker as available vs "Add ELEVENLABS_API_KEY".
- 503 returned with actionable detail when key missing — frontend reads it and flips speaker state to `unavailable` once, then stays quiet (no 503 spam).
- Lightweight char-count logging in `db.voice_narrations` for owner budget awareness.
- Synthesis runs in `run_in_executor` with 20s timeout; defensive 800-char cap on input.
- Used the `elevenlabs` Python SDK (v2.45.0) per integration playbook from `integration_playbook_expert_v2`.

**Frontend — Three Surfaces**
1. **`services/SageVoiceController.js`** — singleton audio + state machine (`idle | loading | speaking | unavailable`). Single `<audio>` element, `subscribe(fn)` for React, `speak(text)` / `stop()` / `checkAvailability()`. Drops in-flight requests when stale (request-id pattern) so abort-then-restart doesn't cause overlapping playback.
2. **`components/AgentHUD.jsx`** — speaker icon between progress and skip buttons. Shows current mode (`VolumeX | Volume | Volume2`), tap-to-play / tap-to-stop in any mode, **double-click or right-click cycles modes** (off → demand → auto → off). Visual states: `data-voice-mode` and `data-voice-state` attributes. Red border + Speaker-X icon when unavailable.
3. **`pages/Settings.js`** — three-button picker (Off / On Demand / Auto) with `data-testid="sage-voice-mode-{id}"`. Description explicitly mentions calm-immersion override and the API key requirement.

**Auto-narration wiring** (`state/ProcessorState.js`)
- Added a window-level (one-time) listener for `ritual:step-active`. Reads `cosmic_prefs.sageVoiceMode`. If `auto` (and not calm), lazy-imports `SageVoiceController` and calls `speak(step.narration || step.label)`.
- Listens for `ritual:chain-abort | chain-aborted | chain-complete` to call `stop()` so audio never outlives the chain.
- Code-split: the audio service only loads when the user actually opts into voice — zero impact on first-paint for the 95% of users who keep voice off.

**SensoryContext additions**
- New `prefs.sageVoiceMode` (default `'off'`).
- New computed `sageVoiceMode` exposed via `useSensory()` — forces `'off'` in calm immersion (no surprise audio).

**Documentation**
- `pages/HelpCenter.js` — added 7th ritual FAQ explaining all three modes, the long-press shortcut on the HUD speaker, and graceful degradation on missing key.

**Test status**
- Backend: **13/13 pytest pass** (4 new sage-voice + 3 V1.0.10 recall + 6 V1.0.9 chain).
- Frontend playwright smoke: HUD speaker rendered with `data-voice-mode=off, data-voice-state=idle`; tap → flipped to `unavailable` (correct, key absent); Settings picker rendered; selecting Auto persisted to `cosmic_prefs.sageVoiceMode='auto'`.

**Files added/changed**
- `backend/routes/voice.py` — new
- `backend/.env` — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=` placeholder
- `backend/requirements.txt` — `elevenlabs==2.45.0`
- `backend/tests/test_iteration_v1_0_11_sage_voice.py` — 4 tests
- `frontend/src/services/SageVoiceController.js` — new
- `frontend/src/state/ProcessorState.js` — auto-narration window listener + lazy-import
- `frontend/src/context/SensoryContext.js` — `sageVoiceMode` pref + computed
- `frontend/src/components/AgentHUD.jsx` — speaker button + mode cycling + state styling
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.js` — Sage Voice picker
- `frontend/src/pages/HelpCenter.js` — FAQ entry

**P1 Backlog (remaining)**
- 🟡 Per-realm voice tonality (earth → grounded male, water → flowing female, etc.) — uses existing `voice_id` param
- 🟡 LanguageBar "Reader" mode — speaker icon next to translator pill that reads the translated active page (deferred per user; scope said Forge-only this sprint)
- 🟡 "Whisper" pulses on dwell threshold (Phase 3 #8)
- 🟢 Veo/Sora video souvenirs at chain-complete (P2)
- 🟢 3D Trophy/Relic Vault in Tesseract (P2)
- ⚪ Muse S Biofeedback (P3)

**To activate Sage Voice in production:**
1. Get an ElevenLabs API key at https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
2. Paste it into `/app/backend/.env` → `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_...`
3. `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`
4. Settings → Sage Voice → On Demand or Auto → run a ritual chain


### V1.0.12 — Voice Preview · Soft-Calm Refinement (2026-05-03) ✅
**The Sage gets a "hello" before you hire it.** Voice preview button in Settings; calm immersion no longer hard-mutes — it whispers.

**Backend** (`backend/routes/voice.py`)
- New `GET /api/voice/sample?voice_id=...&calm=true|false` — synthesizes the fixed `SAMPLE_TEXT` ("Welcome, traveler. I am the Sage…") on first request, caches by `(voice_id, calm)` tuple in `db.voice_samples`. Every subsequent click returns the cached `audio_url` (~0 character cost). Response includes `cached: bool` for budget transparency.
- `_synthesize_sync` now takes a `calm: bool` flag. When true, applies `VoiceSettings(stability=0.85, similarity_boost=0.85, style=0.0, use_speaker_boost=False)` for breathier, slower delivery. Wrapped in try/except so older/newer SDK shapes degrade silently to defaults.
- `POST /api/voice/sage-narrate` body extended with optional `calm: bool`. Plumbed through to `_synthesize_sync`.

**Frontend** (`services/SageVoiceController.js`)
- New `previewSample(opts)` — hits `/api/voice/sample`, plays via the singleton `<audio>` element. Same state stream as `speak()`, so the HUD speaker icon mirrors "speaking" during preview.
- Added `_isCalm()` helper. Both `speak()` and `previewSample()` auto-detect calm immersion and pass `calm: true` to the backend AND drop the `<audio>.volume` to 0.4. Caller can override with `opts.calm`.
- Exposed `previewSample` on `window.SageVoice` for console debugging.

**Calm-immersion contract — refined**
- `SensoryContext.sageVoiceMode` no longer force-`'off'` in calm. Returns the user's chosen mode unchanged. The voice still plays in calm — just at 40% gain with softer timbre. Hard-mute remains available via the explicit "Off" choice.
- `ProcessorState.js` auto-narration listener simplified: drops the calm-forces-off branch (controller handles it).

**Settings UI** (`pages/Settings.js`)
- New `<SageVoicePreviewButton>` inline next to the "Sage Voice" header. Three states via the same controller stream:
  - idle → ▷ PREVIEW
  - loading → spinner
  - speaking → ⬛ STOP
  - unavailable → ▷ NO KEY (red, disabled)
- `data-testid="sage-voice-preview"` + `data-voice-state` for testing.
- Description copy updated: "Calm immersion plays at lower gain with softer delivery" (truthful — not "forced off").

**HelpCenter** — FAQ updates
- Calm immersion entry now says "Sage Voice still plays in Calm — just at 40% volume with softer, breathier delivery."
- Sage Voice entry mentions the PREVIEW button and its server-side cache.

**Test status**
- Backend: **16/16 pytest pass** (3 new voice-sample + V1.0.11/10/9 all green).
- Frontend playwright smoke: PREVIEW button rendered with `data-voice-state=idle`; click → `unavailable` flip with red `▷ NO KEY` text (correct, since key absent in env). All four settings sections (Reduce Motion, Auto-Visuals, Sage Voice, Accessibility) visible inline — no overlay regression.

**Files added/changed**
- `backend/routes/voice.py` — sample endpoint with cache + calm voice settings
- `backend/tests/test_iteration_v1_0_12_voice_sample.py` — 3 tests
- `frontend/src/services/SageVoiceController.js` — `previewSample()` + `_isCalm()` + auto calm gain
- `frontend/src/context/SensoryContext.js` — calm no longer force-mutes
- `frontend/src/state/ProcessorState.js` — simplified auto-narration listener
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.js` — `<SageVoicePreviewButton>` component + section
- `frontend/src/pages/HelpCenter.js` — FAQ refresh

**P1/P2 Backlog (next sprint candidates)**
- 🟡 Per-realm voice tonality (V1.0.13) — 5 voice slots in Settings, voice_id passed at chain start
- 🟡 LanguageBar "Reader" mode — speaker pill that reads the translated active page
- 🟡 "Whisper" pulses on dwell (Phase 3 #8)
- 🟢 Veo/Sora video souvenirs (P2)
- 🟢 3D Trophy/Relic Vault in Tesseract (P2)
- ⚪ Muse S Biofeedback (P3)
